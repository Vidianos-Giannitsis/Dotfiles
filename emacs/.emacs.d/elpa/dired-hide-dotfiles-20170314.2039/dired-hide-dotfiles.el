;;; Commentary:

;; Hide dotfiles in dired.
;;
;; To activate this mode add something like this to your init.el:
;;
;;     (defun my-dired-mode-hook ()
;;       "My `dired' mode hook."
;;       ;; To hide dot-files by default
;;       (dired-hide-dotfiles-mode)
;;
;;       ;; To toggle hiding
;;       (define-key dired-mode-map "." #'dired-hide-dotfiles-mode))
;;
;;     (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'my-dired-mode-hook)
