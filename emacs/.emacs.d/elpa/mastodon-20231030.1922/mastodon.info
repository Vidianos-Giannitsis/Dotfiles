1.1 Installation
================

You can install ‘mastodon.el’ from ELPA, MELPA, or directly from this
repo.  It is also available as a GUIX package.

File: mastodon.info,  Node: ELPA,  Next: MELPA,  Up: Installation

1.1.1 ELPA
----------

You should be able to directly install with:

   ‘M-x package-refresh-contents RET’

   ‘M-x package-install RET mastodon RET’


File: mastodon.info,  Node: MELPA,  Next: Repo,  Prev: ELPA,  Up: Installation

1.1.2 MELPA
-----------

Add ‘MELPA’ to your archives:

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)

   Update and install:

   ‘M-x package-refresh-contents RET’

   ‘M-x package-install RET mastodon RET’


File: mastodon.info,  Node: Repo,  Next: Emoji,  Prev: MELPA,  Up: Installation

1.1.3 Repo
----------

Clone this repository and add the lisp directory to your load path.
Then, require it and go.

     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mastodon.el/lisp")
     (require 'mastodon)

   Or, with ‘use-package’:

     (use-package mastodon
       :ensure t)

   The minimum Emacs version is now 27.1.  But if you are running an
older version it shouldn’t be very hard to get it working.


File: mastodon.info,  Node: Emoji,  Next: Discover,  Prev: Repo,  Up: Installation

1.1.4 Emoji
-----------

‘mastodon-mode’ will enable Emojify
(https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify) if it is loaded in your
Emacs environment, so there’s no need to write your own hook anymore.
‘emojify-mode’ is not required.


File: mastodon.info,  Node: Discover,  Prev: Emoji,  Up: Installation

1.1.5 Discover
--------------

‘mastodon-mode’ can provide a context menu for its keybindings if
Discover (https://github.com/mickeynp/discover.el) is installed.  It is
not required.

   if you have Discover, add the following to your Emacs init
configuration:

     (require 'mastodon-discover)
     (with-eval-after-load 'mastodon (mastodon-discover))

   Or, with ‘use-package’:

     (use-package mastodon
       :ensure t
       :config
       (mastodon-discover))

File: mastodon.info,  Node: Logging in to your instance,  Next: Timelines,  Up: Usage

1.2.1 Logging in to your instance
---------------------------------

You need to set 2 variables in your init file to get started:

  1. ‘mastodon-instance-url’
  2. ‘mastodon-active-user’

   (see their doc strings for details).  For example If you want to post
toots as "example_user@social.instance.org", then put this in your init
file:

     (setq mastodon-instance-url "https://social.instance.org"
           mastodon-active-user "example_user")

   Then *restart* Emacs and run ‘M-x mastodon’.  Make sure you are
connected to internet before you do this.  If you have multiple mastodon
accounts you can activate one at a time by changing those two variables
and restarting Emacs.

   If you were using mastodon.el before 2FA was implemented and the
above steps do not work, delete the old file specified by
‘mastodon-client--token-file’ and restart Emacs and follow the steps
again.


File: mastodon.info,  Node: Timelines,  Next: Composing toots,  Prev: Logging in to your instance,  Up: Usage

1.2.2 Timelines
---------------

‘M-x mastodon’

   Opens a ‘*mastodon-home*’ buffer in the major mode and displays
toots.  If your credentials are not yet saved, you will be prompted for
email and password.  The app registration process will take place if
your ‘mastodon-token-file’ does not contain ‘:client_id’ and
‘:client_secret’.

File: mastodon.info,  Node: Composing toots,  Next: Other commands and account settings,  Prev: Timelines,  Up: Usage

1.2.3 Composing toots
---------------------

‘M-x mastodon-toot’ (or ‘t’ from a mastodon.el buffer) opens a new
buffer/window in ‘text-mode’ and ‘mastodon-toot’ minor mode.  Enter the
contents of your toot here.  ‘C-c C-c’ sends the toot.  ‘C-c C-k’
cancels.  Both actions kill the buffer and window.  Further keybindings
are displayed in the buffer, and in the following subsection.

   Replies preserve visibility status/content warnings, and include
boosters by default.

   Server’s max toot length, and attachment previews, are shown.

   You can download and use your instance’s custom emoji
(‘mastodon-toot--download-custom-emoji’,
‘mastodon-toot--enable-custom-emoji’).

   The compose buffer uses ‘text-mode’ so any configuration you have for
that mode will be enabled.  If any of your existing config conflicts
with ‘mastodon-toot’, you can disable it in the
‘mastodon-toot-mode-hook’.  For example, the default value of that hook
is as follows:

     (add-hook 'mastodon-toot-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                   (auto-fill-mode -1)))

  1. Keybindings

     Key         Action
     -------------------------------------------------
     ‘C-c C-c’   Send toot
     ‘C-c C-k’   Cancel toot
     ‘C-c C-w’   Add content warning
     ‘C-c C-v’   Change toot visibility
     ‘C-c C-n’   Add sensitive media/nsfw flag
     ‘C-c C-a’   Upload attachment(s)
     ‘C-c !’     Remove all attachments
     ‘C-c C-e’   Add emoji (if ‘emojify’ installed)
     ‘C-c C-p’   Create a poll
     ‘C-c C-l’   Set toot language

  2. Autocompletion of mentions and tags

     Autocompletion of mentions and tags is provided by
     ‘completion-at-point-functions’ (capf) backends.
     ‘mastodon-toot--enable-completion’ is enabled by default.  If you
     want to enable ‘company-mode’ in the toot compose buffer, set
     ‘mastodon-toot--use-company-for-completion’ to ‘t’.  (‘mastodon.el’
     used to run its own native company backends, but these have been
     removed in favour of capfs.)

     If you don’t run ‘company’ and want immediate, keyless completion,
     you’ll need to have another completion engine running that handles
     capfs.  A common combination is ‘consult’ and ‘corfu’.

  3. Draft toots

        • Compose buffer text is saved as you type, kept in
          ‘mastodon-toot-current-toot-text’.
        • ‘mastodon-toot--save-draft’: save the current toot as a draft.
        • ‘mastodon-toot--open-draft-toot’: Open a compose buffer and
          insert one of your draft toots.
        • ‘mastodon-toot--delete-draft-toot’: Delete a draft toot.
        • ‘mastodon-toot--delete-all-drafts’: Delete all your drafts.

1.2.7 Alternative timeline layout

layout for ‘mastodon.el’.

   The repo is at mastodon-alt
(https://github.com/rougier/mastodon-alt).

1.2.8 Live-updating timelines: ‘mastodon-async-mode’
----------------------------------------------------

(code taken from mastodon-future
(https://github.com/alexjgriffith/mastodon-future.el).)

   Works for federated, local, and home timelines and for notifications.
It’s a little touchy, one thing to avoid is trying to load a timeline
more than once at a time.  It can go off the rails a bit, but it’s still
pretty cool.  The current maintainer of ‘mastodon.el’ is unable to debug
or improve this feature.

   To enable, it, add ‘(require 'mastodon-async)’ to your ‘init.el’.
Then you can view a timeline with one of the commands that begin with
‘mastodon-async--stream-’.


File: mastodon.info,  Node: Translating toots,  Next: Bookmarks and mastodonel,  Prev: Live-updating timelines mastodon-async-mode,  Up: Usage

1.2.9 Translating toots
-----------------------

You can translate toots with ‘mastodon-toot--translate-toot-text’ (‘a’
in a timeline).  At the moment this requires lingva.el
(https://codeberg.org/martianh/lingva.el), a little interface I wrote to
lingva.ml (https://lingva.ml), to be installed to work.

   You could easily modify the simple function to use your Emacs
translator of choice (‘libretrans.el’ , ‘google-translate’, ‘babel’,
‘go-translate’, etc.), you just need to fetch the toot’s content with
‘(mastodon-tl--content toot)’ and pass it to your translator function as
its text argument.  Here’s what ‘mastodon-toot--translate-toot-text’
looks like:

     (defun mastodon-toot--translate-toot-text ()
       "Translate text of toot at point.
       Uses `lingva.el'."
         (interactive)
         (let* ((toot (mastodon-tl--property 'item-json)))
           (if toot
               (lingva-translate nil (mastodon-tl--content toot))
             (message "No toot to translate?"))))

1.2.10 Bookmarks and ‘mastodon.el’
----------------------------------

‘mastodon.el’ doesn’t currently implement its own bookmark record and
handler, which means that emacs bookmarks will not work as is.  Until we
implement them, you can get bookmarks going immediately by using
bookmark+.el
(https://github.com/emacsmirror/emacswiki.org/blob/master/bookmark%2b.el).


File: mastodon.info,  Node: Dependencies,  Next: Network compatibility,  Prev: Usage,  Up: README

1.3 Dependencies
================

Hard dependencies (should all install with ‘mastodon.el’):
   • ‘request’ (for uploading attachments), emacs-request
     (https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request)
   • ‘persist’ for storing some settings across sessions

   Optional dependencies (install yourself, ‘mastodon.el’ can use them):
   • ‘emojify’ for inserting and viewing emojis
   • ‘mpv’ and ‘mpv.el’ for viewing videos and gifs
   • ‘lingva.el’ for translating toots


File: mastodon.info,  Node: Network compatibility,  Next: Contributing,  Prev: Dependencies,  Up: README

1.4 Network compatibility
=========================

‘mastodon.el’ should work with ActivityPub servers that implement the
Mastodon API.

   Apart from Mastodon itself, it is currently known to work with:
   • Pleroma (pleroma.social (https://pleroma.social/))
   • Akkoma (akkoma.social (https://akkoma.social/))
   • Gotosocial (gotosocial.org (https://gotosocial.org/))

   It does not support the non-Mastodon API servers Misskey (misskey.io
(https://misskey.io/)), Firefish (joinfirefish.org
(https://joinfirefish.org/), formerly Calkey) and Friendica, but it

1.5.1 Bug reports
-----------------

  1. ‘mastodon.el’ has bugs, as well as lots of room for improvement.
  2. I receive very little feedback, so if I don’t run into the bug it
     often doesn’t get fixed.
  3. If you run into something that seems broken, first try running
     ‘mastodon.el’ in emacs with no init file (i.e.  ‘emacs -q’
     (instructions and code for doing this are here
     (https://codeberg.org/martianh/mastodon.el/issues/300)) to see if
     it also happens independently of your own config (it probably
     does).
  4. Enable debug on error (‘toggle-debug-on-error’), make the bug
     happen again, and copy the backtrace that appears.
  5. Open an issue here and explain what is going on.  Provide your
     emacs version and what kind of server your account is on.

1.5.2 Fixes and features
------------------------

  1. Create an issue (https://codeberg.org/martianh/mastodon.el/issues)
     detailing what you’d like to do.
  2. Fork the repository and create a branch off of ‘develop’.
  3. Run the tests and ensure that your code doesn’t break any of them.
  4. Create a pull request referencing the issue created in step 1.

1.5.3 Coding style
------------------

   • This library uses an unconvential double dash (‘--’) between file
     namespaces and function names, which contradicts normal Elisp
     style.  This needs to be respected until the whole library is
     changed.
   • Use ‘aggressive-indent-mode’ or similar to keep your code indented.
   • Single spaces end sentences in docstrings.
   • There’s no need for a blank line after the first docstring line
     (one is added automatically when documentation is displayed).
