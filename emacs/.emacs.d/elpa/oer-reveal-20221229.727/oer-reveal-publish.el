;;; Commentary:
;; This file contains setup code to publish reveal.js presentations
;; from Org source files with oer-reveal.
;;
;; Function `oer-reveal-publish-all' is meant to be used in batch mode
;; (more details follow below) and invokes the standard Org export
;; function `org-publish-all' to publish all projects of
;; `org-publish-project-alist'.  That latter list of projects is
;; mostly set up by code in `oer-reveal-publish-all', but your
;; pre-existing projects are exported as well.
;; Org source files (except explicitly excluded ones) are published
;; according to `oer-reveal-publish-org-publishing-functions'.  Other
;; resources (e.g., reveal.js and plugins, CSS, figures) are copied with
;; `org-publish-attachment'.
;; The target directory is "public".
;;
;; If file "index.org" is present in the current directory (e.g., to
;; collect links to generated reveal.js presentations), it is added to
;; `org-publish-project-alist' for export with
;; `oer-reveal-publish-index-publishing-functions' (with the standard
;; HTML export back-end by default).
;; If existing, file "index.css" and directories among "audio",
;; "figures", "quizzes" are added to `org-publish-project-alist'
;; for export as attachment (copy).  A sample quiz on the usage of
;; oer-reveal is included and published automatically to directory
;; "public/quizzes".
;;
;; You may want to load/require this file from your own publish.el
;; with additional entries added to `org-publish-project-alist'.
;; Then, invoke publication based on your own publish.el:
;; emacs --batch --load publish.el --funcall oer-reveal-publish-all
;;
;; Warning!  By default, `oer-reveal-publish-all' let-binds
;; `org-confirm-babel-evaluate' to `oer-reveal-publish-confirm-evaluate',
;; which defaults to nil.
;; This enables automatic execution of code embedded in Org source
;; files.  This may be dangerous, but is useful for execution in batch
;; mode.  Set `oer-reveal-publish-confirm-evaluate' to t to be asked
;; for confirmation.
;; Also, `oer-reveal-publish-all' invokes the function specified in
;; `oer-reveal-publish-faces-function' to change faces for syntax
;; highlighting in batch mode; set that variable to nil to avoid such
;; changes.
;;
;; Function `oer-reveal-publish-setq-defaults' activates Org Babel
;; languages and changes `org-export-before-processing-hook'.
;; Please check what it does before invoking it.
;;
;; Originally inspired by publish.el by Rasmus:
;; https://gitlab.com/pages/org-mode/blob/master/publish.el
