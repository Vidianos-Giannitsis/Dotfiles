;;; Commentary:

;; Multi-stage and asynchronous copy/paste/link utilities in Dirvish.

;; With the multi-stage operations, you can gather files from multiple Dired
;; buffers into a single "clipboard", then copy or move all of them to the
;; target location.

;; Here are the available commands:
;; Note that they are asynchronous and work on both localhost and remote host.
;; - `dirvish-yank'
;; - `dirvish-move'
;; - `dirvish-symlink'
;; - `dirvish-relative-symlink'
;; - `dirvish-hardlink'
