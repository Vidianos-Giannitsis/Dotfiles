;;; Commentary:

;; A Julia Snail extension to format regions and buffers using JuliaFormatter.jl
;; (https://github.com/domluna/JuliaFormatter.jl). Inspired by
;; https://codeberg.org/FelipeLema/julia-formatter.el.

;;; Code:


;;; --- requirements

(require 'julia-snail)


;;; --- initialiation function

(defun julia-snail/formatter-init (repl-buf)
  (julia-snail--send-to-server
    '("JuliaSnail" "Extensions")
    "load([\"formatter\" \"Formatter.jl\"]); Formatter.init()"
    :repl-buf repl-buf
    :async nil
    :async-poll-maximum 120000))


;;; --- implementation

(defun julia-snail/formatter--format-text (txt)
  (julia-snail--send-to-server
    '("JuliaSnail" "Extensions" "Formatter")
    (format "format_data(\"%s\")" (base64-encode-string txt))
    :async nil))


(defun julia-snail/formatter-format-region (begin end)
  "Format region delimited by BEGIN and END using JuliaFormatter.jl.
The code in the region must be syntactically valid Julia, otherwise no formatting will take place."
  (interactive "r")
  (let* ((text-to-be-formatted (buffer-substring-no-properties begin end))
         (ftext (julia-snail/formatter--format-text text-to-be-formatted)))
    (if (eq :nothing ftext)
        (message "Parsing error, formatting failed")
      (delete-region begin end)
      (insert ftext))))


(defun julia-snail/formatter-format-buffer ()
  "Format buffer using JuliaFormatter.jl.
The buffer must be syntactically valid Julia, otherwise no formatting will take place.
Point placement after reformatting is sketchy, since the code might have changed quite a bit."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((old-point (point)))
    (julia-snail/formatter-format-region (point-min) (point-max))
    (goto-char old-point)))


;;; --- extension minor-mode

  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c j f r") #'julia-snail/formatter-format-region)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c j f b") #'julia-snail/formatter-format-buffer)
    map))

(define-minor-mode julia-snail/formatter-mode
  "Julia Snail extension: JuliaFormatter.jl integration."
  :init-value nil

;;; --- done
