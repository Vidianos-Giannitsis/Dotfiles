;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides an `orderless' completion style that divides
;; the pattern into components (space-separated by default), and
;; matches candidates that match all of the components in any order.

;; Completion styles are used as entries in the variables
;; `completion-styles' and `completion-category-overrides', see their
;; documentation.

;; To use this completion style you can use the following minimal
;; configuration:

;; (setq completion-styles '(orderless))

;; You can customize the `orderless-component-separator' to decide how
;; the input pattern is split into component regexps.  The default
;; splits on spaces.  You might want to add hyphens and slashes, for
;; example, to ease completion of symbols and file paths,
;; respectively.

;; Each component can match in any one of several matching styles:
;; literally, as a regexp, as an initialism, in the flex style, or as
;; word prefixes.  It is easy to add new styles: they are functions
;; from strings to strings that map a component to a regexp to match
;; against.  The variable `orderless-matching-styles' lists the
;; matching styles to be used for components, by default it allows
;; literal and regexp matching.

component and optionally replace the component with a different
string, or it can decline to handle the component leaving it for
future dispatchers.  For details see `orderless-dispatch'.

For example, a style dispatcher could arrange for the first
component to match as an initialism and subsequent components to
match as literals.  As another example, a style dispatcher could
arrange for a component starting with `?' to match the rest of
the component in the `orderless-flex' style.  For more

A style dispatcher is a function that takes a string and possibly
some extra arguments.  It should either return (a) nil to
indicate the dispatcher will not handle the string, (b) a new
string to replace the current string and continue dispatch,
or (c) the matching styles to use and, if needed, a new string to
use in place of the current one (for example, a dispatcher can
decide which style to use based on a suffix of the string and
then it must also return the component stripped of the suffix).

More precisely, the return value of a style dispatcher can be of
one of the following forms:

- nil (to continue dispatching)

- a string (to replace the component and continue dispatching),

- a matching style or non-empty list of matching styles to
  return,

- a `cons' whose `car' is either as in the previous case or
  nil (to request returning the DEFAULT matching styles), and
  whose `cdr' is a string (to replace the current one).

This function tries all DISPATCHERS in sequence until one returns
a list of styles (passing any extra ARGS to every style
dispatcher).  When that happens it returns a `cons' of the list
of styles and the possibly updated STRING.  If none of the
DISPATCHERS returns a list of styles, the return value will use
DEFAULT as the list of styles."

with `let' to configure orderless.  You can include bindings for
`orderless-matching-styles' and `orderless-style-dispatchers',
for example.

The completion style consists of two functions that this macro
defines for you, NAME-try-completion and NAME-all-completions.
This macro registers those in `completion-styles-alist' as
forming the completion style NAME.
