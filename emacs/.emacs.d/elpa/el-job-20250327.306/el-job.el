;;; Commentary:

;; Imagine you have a function you'd like to run on a long list of inputs.
;; You could run (mapcar #'FN INPUTS), but that hangs Emacs until done.

;; This library lets you split up the inputs and run the function in many
;; subprocesses---one per CPU core---then merge their outputs and handle the
;; result as if it had been returned by that `mapcar'.  In the meantime,
;; current Emacs does not hang at all.

;; You need to know the concept of a callback.

;; Public API:
;; - Function `el-job-launch' (read its docstring)
;; - Function `el-job-await'
;; - Function `el-job-is-busy'
;; - Variable `el-job-major-version'

;; Dev tools:
;; - Command `el-job-cycle-debug-level'
;; - Command `el-job-show-info'
;; - Command `el-job-kill-all'

;;; Code:

;; Wish-list:
;; - Figure out how to allow more than one list of INPUTS.  That'd give this
;;   library much wider applicability!

;; - Figure out how to use `dump-emacs-portable' after loading all desired
;;   features, so we can reuse that to start the subprocesses nigh-instantly.
;;   Could even simplify to a sentinel-based workflow then, no polling.

  "Run FUNCALL-PER-INPUT in one or more headless Elisp processes.
Then merge the return values \(lists of N lists) into one list
\(of N lists) and pass it to CALLBACK.

i.e. each subprocess may return lists like

process 1: \((city1 city2) (road1) (museum1 museum2))
process 2: \((city3 city4 city5) (road2) (museum3))
process 3: ...

but at the end, these lists are merged into a single list shaped just like
any one of those above, with the difference that the sublists have more
elements:

\((city1 city2 city3 city4 city5)
  (road1 road2)
  (museum1 museum2 museum3))

which is why it's important that FUNCALL-PER-INPUT always returns a list
with a fixed-in-advance number of sub-lists, enabling this merge.
These sub-lists are allowed to be empty, i.e. nil, but not absent.

The fixed-in-advance number can also be zero, i.e. FUNCALL-PER-INPUT may
be designed to always return nil.


FUNCALL-PER-INPUT is a symbol known to be defined in some Emacs Lisp
file as a function of one argument.

Usually, it would be a function you have written yourself, and you pass
LOAD-FEATURES to indicate where to find that Emacs Lisp file, plus any
dependencies not built into Emacs.

LOAD-FEATURES is a list of symbols like those in `features'\; the files
in question should end with a `provide' call on the same symbols.

The subprocesses do not inherit `load-path', it is the current Emacs
process that locates files \(by inspecting `load-history', via
`el-job--ensure-compiled-lib'), then gives them to each subprocess.


INPUTS is a list that will be split by up to the output of
`num-processors', and this determines how many subprocesses will spawn.

INPUTS can also be a function that returns a list.  In this case, the
function is deferred until needed, possibly saving on compute.

If INPUTS returns nil, do nothing and return the symbol
`inputs-were-empty'.


The subprocesses have no access to current Emacs state.  The only way
they can affect current state, is if FUNCALL-PER-INPUT returns data,
which is then handled by CALLBACK function in the current Emacs.

Emacs stays responsive to user input up until all subprocesses finish,
which is when their results are merged and CALLBACK is executed.

CALLBACK receives two arguments: the results as mentioned before, and the
job object.  The latter is mainly useful to check timestamps,
which you can get from this form:

    \(el-job-timestamps JOB)


ID is a symbol identifying this job.  It has several purposes:

- Prevent launching the same job twice, if the last invocation is not
  done yet.  Argument IF-BUSY regulates what happens instead.

- Allow repeated calls on the same inputs to optimize how those inputs
  are split, thanks to benchmarks from previous calls.


IF-BUSY comes into effect when the previous launch with the same ID is
still at work.  IF-BUSY may take on one of three symbols:

- `wait' \(default): append the inputs to a queue, to be handled
                     after all children are ready
- `noop': do nothing, drop inputs
- `takeover': kill and restart with the new inputs

For debugging, see these commands:
- `el-job-cycle-debug-level'
- `el-job-show-info'
- `el-job-kill-all'"
