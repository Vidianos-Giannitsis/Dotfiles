* Introduction
*Beware!* This file uses [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] syntax.
Some headers (with Org commands and comments) are not displayed
(properly) on GitLab.

Use the source.

*Note:* The citation syntax introduced by Org mode 9.5 is supported by
the alternative package
[[https://gitlab.com/oer/org-re-reveal-citeproc][org-re-reveal-citeproc]].

** Installation
   - Install [[https://revealjs.com/][reveal.js]] and ~org-re-reveal~ (from MELPA or [[https://gitlab.com/oer/org-re-reveal/][GitLab]])
   - Activate ~org-re-reveal-ref~
     - Place this directory into your load path or install it from
       [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][MELPA]]
     - Load package manually (~M-x load-library~ followed by
       ~org-re-reveal-ref~) or place ~(require 'org-re-reveal-ref)~ into your
       "~/.emacs" and restart
   - Load an Org file and export it to HTML
     - Make sure that reveal.js is available in your current directory
       (e.g., as sub-directory or symbolic link)
     - Load "README.org" (coming with org-re-reveal-ref)
     - Export to HTML: Press ~C-c C-e v v~ (write HTML file) or
       ~C-c C-e v b~ (write HTML file and open in browser)

** Configuration
   - Package ~org-ref~ needs to know what bibliography file(s) to use
   - Several options
     - First, org-ref understands the command ~printbibliography~ used
       in the source file of this README
       - For PDF export, this file also contains additional LaTeX
         headers

         #+begin_src latex
#+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[backend=biber,style=alphabetic]{biblatex}
#+LATEX_HEADER: \addbibresource{references.bib}
         #+end_src
     - Second, ~addbibresource:references.bib~ can be used before
       ~printbibliography~ if PDF export is not necessary
     - Third, ~org-ref-default-bibliography~ can be customized

** Rationale
   - Teaching and learning resources should be free and open
     - In support of
       [[https://www.sdg4education2030.org/the-goal][Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4)]]
     - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources][Open Educational Resources (OER)]]
       - See cite:HWS+10 for technical and legal requirements of OER
   - My OER requirements (see cite:Lec19)
     - (Re-) Usable with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software][FLOSS]]
     - Following paradigm of single sourcing (see cite:Roc01)
     - Platform independent, also offline use
     - Support proper license attribution beyond copy&paste
       - Tool support with [[https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal][emacs-reveal]],
         which embeds ~org-re-reveal-ref~ (see cite:Lec19b,Lec19c)

* Reveal.js presentations
** Org-re-reveal
   - [[https://gitlab.com/oer/org-re-reveal/][Org-re-reveal]] provides
     [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] export functionality to
     generate HTML presentations with
     [[https://revealjs.com/][reveal.js]]
     - See cite:SD11 for an introduction to Org mode
   - Such presentations offer lots of features
     - Themes, animations, and slide transitions
     - Speaker’s view with preview, notes, and timer
     - Embedding of images, audio, video, mathematical formulas
     - Many more

** Org-re-reveal-ref
   - Package ~org-re-reveal-ref~ adds support for citations and bibliography to
     ~org-re-reveal~
     - Use citations of [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]]
       as usual
     - With export to reveal.js and PDF
   - FLOSS software bundle [[https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal][emacs-reveal]]
     contains ~org-re-reveal-ref~
     - Configuration of additional plugins for reveal.js, in
       particular audio explanations
     - Automatic license attribution for OER figures
     - See [[https://oer.gitlab.io/OS/][OER presentations for a course on operating systems]]
       for an example

* Conclusions
** Summary
   - Use ~cite~ commands as usual
   - Insert bibliography on separate slide with ~printbibliography~
     - See next slide
     - Important: You must use a ~CUSTOM_ID~ on that slide, whose
       value is that of customizable variable ~org-re-reveal-ref-bib~

** Bibliography

   :CUSTOM_ID: bibliography
   :END:
