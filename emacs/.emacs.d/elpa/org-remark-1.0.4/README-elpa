1 Introduction
==============

  Org-remark lets you highlight and annotate any text file with using
  Org mode.

  A user manual is available [online] (Info node will be available when
  Org-remark is added to ELPA/MELPA) or Emacs in-system as an Info node
  `(org-remark)': (`C-h i' and find the `Org-remark' node).

  For installation and minimum configuration, refer to [Installation]
  below or the user manual: [online] or Info node `(org-remark)
  Installation'

  Getting Started in the user manual will get you started in 5 minutes:
  [online] or or Info node `(org-remark) Getting Started'.

  For customization, refer to the customization group `org-remark' or
  user manual: [online] or Info node `(org-remark) Customizing'.

  An [introductory video] (8 minutes) is available on YouTube.

2 Installation
==============

  This package is available on:

  - [GNU-ELPA] (releases only; equivalent to MELPA-Stable)
  - [GNU-devel ELPA] (unreleased development branch; equivalent to
    MELPA)


  GNU ELPA should be already set up in your Emacs by default. If you
  wish to add GNU-devel ELPA, simply add its URL to `package-archives'
  like this:

  ,----
  | (add-to-list 'package-archives
  | 	     '("gnu-devel" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/") :append)
  `----

  After installation, we suggest you put the setup below in your
  configuration.

  ,----
  | (require 'org-remark-global-tracking)
  | (org-remark-global-tracking-mode +1)
  `----

  Unless you explicitly load `org' during Emacs initialization, I
  suggest to defer loading `org-remark' (thus there is no `(require
  'org-remark)' in the example above). This is because it will also pull
  in `org', which can slow down initialization. You can control the
  timing of loading `org-remark' by autoloading some commands in a
  similar way with the example keybindings below.

  Below are example keybindings you might like to consider:

  ,----
  | ;; Key-bind `org-remark-mark' to global-map so that you can call it
  | ;; globally before the library is loaded.
  | 
  | (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c n m") #'org-remark-mark)
  | 
  | ;; The rest of keybidings are done only on loading `org-remark'
  | (with-eval-after-load 'org-remark
  |   (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n o") #'org-remark-open)
  |   (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n ]") #'org-remark-view-next)
  |   (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n [") #'org-remark-view-prev)
  |   (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n r") #'org-remark-remove))
