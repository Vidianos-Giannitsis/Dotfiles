specify what you should be able to do after having worked through a
presentation.  Thus, they offer guidance for your learning.

Each learning objective consists of two major components, namely an
/action/ verb and a topic.  Action verbs specify what actions you
should be able to perform concerning the topic, and they indicate the
target level of skill (in Bloom’s Taxonomy or its revised version as
