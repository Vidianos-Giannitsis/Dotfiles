@item
@AUCTeX{} now requires GNU Emacs 26.1 or higher.

@item
@LaTeX{} abbrevs are now available in doc@TeX{} mode buffers.

@item
@AUCTeX{} temporarily rebinds the variable @code{gc-cons-percentage} to a
higher value during parsing which speeds up the process significantly.
The memory pressure should still be acceptable, even on older machines.

@item
Macros provided by the @file{xparse} package are part of @LaTeX{} kernel
since October 2020.  @AUCTeX{} tracks this change and the content of
@file{xparse.el} is moved into @file{latex.el} and @file{font-latex.el}
respectively.

@item
The variable @code{preview-scale-function} is now allowed as a file-local
variable where the assigned value can only be between 0.1 and 10.

@itemize @bullet
@item
@AUCTeX{} no longer refuses to insert dollar sign when you type @kbd{$} at
point where @AUCTeX{} thinks the current math mode didn't start with
dollar(s).  @AUCTeX{} assumes the user knows that it isn't in math mode
actually.

You can keep the former behavior by enabling the new customize option
@code{TeX-refuse-unmatched-dollar}.

@item
@AUCTeX{} supports completion-at-point of macro and environment arguments
in @LaTeX{} buffers.  The responsible function recognizes the argument
position and extracts the corresponding candidates from the variables
@code{TeX-symbol-list} and @code{LaTeX-environment-list}.

@item
@AUCTeX{} underlines the argument of macros which produce underlined text
in the final product with @code{font-latex-underline-face}.  The
corresponding keyword class is called @code{underline-command}.

@item
Support for the Sioyek document viewer is added.

@item
@AUCTeX{} now requires GNU Emacs 25.1 or higher.

@item
@AUCTeX{} tracks the change in Emacs where initial inputs in the
minibuffer during queries are getting phased out.  Queries for the
mandatory arguments of macros and environments are adjusted where
applicable.  The value which will be used after hitting @kbd{RET} without
other input is shown in the prompt in parentheses prefixed with
@samp{default}.  For this change the signature of the function
@code{TeX-arg-length} is altered.  The old argument list was:
@lisp
(defun TeX-arg-length (optional &optional prompt
                                initial-input definition default)
@end lisp

whereas the new one is:
@lisp
(defun TeX-arg-length (optional &optional prompt
                                default initial-input definition)
@end lisp

Note the position change of @code{DEFAULT}.

@item
Indenting of conditionals is improved.  Code inside constructs like
@samp{\ifx . \else . \fi} is correctly indented.  An interface for style
files is also introduced which can add their macros to the indentation
engine.  Check the file @file{algpseudocode.el} for an example.

@item
You can optionally enable indent inside square brackets @samp{[]} by new
user options @code{TeX-indent-open-delimiters} and
@code{TeX-indent-close-delimiters}.
@ifclear rawfile

@end ifclear

@item
Now @file{tex-buf.el} is merged into @file{tex.el} and no longer exists.
If your personal code has @code{(require 'tex-buf)}, one of the following
prescriptions would serve.
@enumerate
@item
Remove @code{(require 'tex-buf)}.
@item
Replace it with @code{(require 'tex)}.
@item
Replace it with @code{(require 'latex)}.
@end enumerate

@item
When you edit a document divided into multiple files, auto parsed
information for all sub files are saved under @file{auto} subdirectory at
master directory when @code{TeX-parse-self} and @code{TeX-auto-save}
options are enabled.  Now you can have support @file{.el} file saved under
@file{auto} subdirectory of each directory of the sub file when the sub
files aren't located at the master directory.

To achieve that, set new user option @code{TeX-auto-save-aggregate} to
@code{nil}.

@item
There was another hook where former dynamic free variables could be used.
The usage was invalidated at version 13.1, by introduction of lexical
binding over @AUCTeX{}.

The functions in @code{TeX-region-hook} could access the free variables
@code{master-buffer} and @code{orig-buffer}.  Those are now named
@code{TeX-region-master-buffer} and @code{TeX-region-orig-buffer},
respectively.
@end itemize

@heading News in 13.1

@itemize @bullet
@item
In math environments @samp{gather}, @samp{gather*}, @samp{gathered},
@samp{multline} and @samp{multline*}, fill commands such as @kbd{M-q} and
@kbd{C-c C-q C-e} are disabled.  This sorts out the inconsistency between
those and @samp{equation}, @samp{displaymath} environments, in latter of
which filling is already disabled.

If you want filling in such environments, customize
@code{LaTeX-indent-environment-list} to remove them.

Auto fill continues to work in such environment anyway.

In addition, @AUCTeX{} adds support of alignment at @samp{&} sign in
@samp{align}-like environments such as @samp{alignat}, @samp{aligned} and
so on, as well as @samp{matrix}-like environments such as @samp{pmatrix},
@samp{bmatrix} and so on.

@item
Now two commands @samp{Texindex} and @samp{Texi2dvi} are available when
you type @kbd{C-c C-c} in Texinfo mode.  The command @samp{Texindex} runs
@command{texindex} on index files and @samp{Texi2dvi} runs
@command{pdftexi2dvi} or @command{texi2dvi} according to the value of
@code{TeX-PDF-mode}.

So you can typeset Texinfo documents into @acronym{PDF} or @acronym{DVI}
format from within @AUCTeX{}.

@item
@AUCTeX{}'s own help messages for @LaTeX{} errors are now shown only for
@LaTeX{} runs.  @AUCTeX{} shows raw error/warning messages found in
@file{.log} files for runs of formats other than @LaTeX{}, such as plain
@TeX{}, @ConTeXt{} and Texinfo, as it does even for @LaTeX{} runs when it
can't find a matching entry in its own help message catalogue.

Due to this change, customize option @code{TeX-error-description-list} can
no longer have a fallback entry that matches any error.  If your
customized value includes such entry, typically @samp{(".*" . "No help
available")}, please remove it.

@item
Two functions @code{TeX-split-string} and @code{TeX-assoc} are now
obsolete and will be removed in future release.  If your personal code
uses these functions, use @code{split-string} and @code{assoc-string}
instead.

@item
The function @code{TeX-read-key-val} now accepts a function call as second
argument.  This change should help @AUCTeX{} style writers who use
@code{TeX-arg-key-val} and have to deal with dynamic key-values.  Example
of usage:
@lisp
(TeX-add-style-hook "foo"
 (lambda ()
   (TeX-add-symbols
    '("bar" (TeX-arg-key-val (function-returning-key-val))))))
@end lisp

@item
Since @AUCTeX{} 12.2, @kbd{C-x C-w} accidentally disabled the parse on
save in that buffer, even when you enabled @code{TeX-auto-save} option.
This bug was fixed.

@item
@AUCTeX{} now requires GNU Emacs 24.3 or higher.

@item
Old implementations for viewers were discarded, as announced long before.
The variables @code{TeX-output-view-style} and @code{TeX-view-style} have
no effect now.  The former placeholders @samp{%v} and @samp{%vv} in
@code{TeX-command-list} are ignored.

@item
@AUCTeX{} now uses lexical binding which has been introduced in Emacs
24.  This change should have no user-visible effect and require no
manual adaptions except in the following cases.

@itemize @minus
@item
Entries added to the customization variable @code{TeX-expand-list} also
had access to variables @code{command} and @code{pos}.  Those are now
properly declared and named @code{TeX-expand-command} and
@code{TeX-expand-pos}.

@item
Entries added to the customization variable @code{TeX-expand-list} had
access to a variable @code{file} which was bound to
@code{TeX-active-master}, i.e., it evaluated to either the master or
region file.  This usage must be replaced with either
@code{TeX-active-master} or @code{TeX-active-master-with-quotes}.

@item
Viewer entries in @code{TeX-view-program-list} also had access to a
variable @code{file} which was bound to the name of the master or region
file without extension.  Instead, the function @code{TeX-active-master}
has to be used now.

@item
Macro argument parsing functions could set a variable @code{exit-mark}
to the buffer position where point should be left after all arguments
have been read.  This variable is now named @code{TeX-exit-mark}.

@item
The functions in @code{LaTeX-section-hook} had access or modified the
previously undeclared variables @code{title}, @code{name}, @code{level},
@code{done-mark}, and @code{toc}.  These variables are now properly
declared and have the @samp{LaTeX-} prefix, e.g.,
@code{LaTeX-done-mark}.

@item
The functions in @code{ConTeXt-numbered-section-hook} and
@code{ConTeXt-unnumbered-section-hook} had access or modified the
previously undeclared variables @code{title}, @code{name}, @code{level},
@code{done-mark}, and @code{reference}.  These variables are now
properly declared and have the @samp{ConTeXt-} prefix, e.g.,
@code{ConTeXt-title}.

@item
The functions in @code{TeX-translate-location-hook} could access and
modify the free variables @code{file}, @code{line}, @code{error},
@code{offset}, @code{context}, and @code{string}.  Those are now properly
declared variables with the prefix @samp{TeX-translate-location-}, e.g.,
@code{TeX-translate-location-file}.
@end itemize

@item
The constant @code{LaTeX-dialect} has been renamed to @code{TeX-dialect}
and moved from @file{latex.el} to @file{tex.el}.  @code{LaTeX-dialect}
now is an obsolete alias.

@item
The style @file{latexinfo.el} is removed from @AUCTeX{}.
@file{latexinfo.el} was meant to support latexinfo which in return was a
@LaTeX{}-2.09 extension of Texinfo, but didn't manage to replace Texinfo.

@item
The style @file{siunitx.el} is updated to support package version 3.
Key-value options provided by older package versions are removed,
deprecated macros and units are not supported anymore.

@item
@AUCTeX{} has preliminary support for @LaTeX{}-hooks.  Hooks provided by
@LaTeX{} kernel are known and available for completion in
@samp{\AddToHook}, @samp{\RemoveFromHook} and @samp{\AddToHookNext}.

@item
@AUCTeX{} is now able to place all generated output files, including those
that are produced by applications running under @AUCTeX{}, temporary files
related to region processing and @previewlatex{} files, in an output
directory.  To use this feature, set the new user option
@code{TeX-output-dir} to the absolute path of the output directory or a
relative path which would be interpreted as being relative to the master
file in a multifile document.

Note that this feature doesn't work if the document includes sub file
placed in sub directory below the main file via @samp{\include} command.

@item
Many other bugs were fixed.
@end itemize

@heading News in 12.3

@itemize @bullet
@item
Support for @samp{PSTricks} is now @acronym{PDF}-oriented.  @AUCTeX{} no
longer turns off PDF mode for @samp{PSTricks} documents even without
@samp{pst-pdf}.  It now sets up @code{TeX-PDF-from-DVI} option so that
@acronym{PDF} output is generated when @code{TeX-PDF-mode} is enabled
(default).  Users who want @acronym{DVI} output should disable PDF mode
explicitly by file local variable, or customize @code{TeX-PDF-mode} to
@code{nil}.

@item
The function @code{font-latex-update-font-lock} has been obsoleted in
order to fix @samp{bug#37945}.  That function was used by several style
files in order to refresh fontification after adding new symbols or
verbatim constructs.  It is better to call @code{font-lock-flush} in the
former case and @code{font-latex-set-syntactic-keywords} in the latter
case.  The function @code{font-latex-update-font-lock} still exists as a
no-op which only shows a warning explaining how to update font-lock as
mentioned above.

@item
Math expression highlighting was improved.  Highlighting for documents
with a lot of inline math expressions @samp{$...$} won't get scrambled
now (@samp{bug#33139}).

In addition, it is no longer recommended to customize
@code{font-latex-math-environments}.  Use @code{texmathp-tex-commands}
instead.

@item
@AUCTeX{} tracks changes in @LaTeX{}2e 2020-02-02 release.  @AUCTeX{}
supports the improvements to @LaTeX{} font selection mechanism (NFSS).
New macros like @samp{\textsw} or @samp{\textulc} are added to font
insertion keyboard commands.
@ifset rawfile
See the section for inserting font specifiers for details.
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
@xref{Font Specifiers}, for details.
@end ifclear
Further, the entries in the menu @samp{LaTeX}, @samp{Insert Font} are reorganized and
adjusted accordingly.

Macros previously provided by @file{textcomp.sty} are now part of
@LaTeX{} kernel.  @AUCTeX{} tracks this change as well and support for
the new macro @samp{\legacyoldstylenums} is added.

@item
Insertion of environments in @LaTeX{} documents (i.e.@: @kbd{C-c C-e}) was
improved.  The former code had a few bugs, which sometimes resulted in
either spurious empty line or spurious comment prefix, or both,
especially when the region is active.  Those bugs are now fixed.

@item
More bugs fixed, other minor features implemented.
@end itemize

@heading News in 12.2

@itemize @bullet
@item
@AUCTeX{} reflects the changes in @LaTeX{}2e 2019-10-01 release.
@samp{filecontents} environment now takes an optional argument and can
be used anywhere in a document.  The macros @samp{\Ref} and
@samp{\labelformat} are moved from @file{varioref.sty} to @LaTeX{}
kernel.  @samp{amsmath} has a new macro @samp{\overunderset}.

@item
A new method is implemented in @previewlatex{} to adjust the foreground
colors of generated images to those of Emacs, when the @LaTeX{} command
produces @acronym{PDF}.  The traditional method became invalid because
of the change introduced in Ghostscript 9.27.  Unfortunately, the new
method doesn't work due to a bug in Ghostscript 9.27 and is valid only
for Ghostscript > 9.27.  There is also a fallback method for gs 9.27
users which displays plain ``black on white'' images.  For successful
function of @previewlatex{}, the users are encouraged to set up the new
user option @code{preview-pdf-color-adjust-method} to choose appropriate
option among the three: new, traditional and fallback method.

@item
@AUCTeX{} has support for the Flymake package in Emacs 26 or newer.  To
enable, call @kbd{M-x flymake-mode @key{RET}} or add this to your
@file{.emacs} file:
@lisp
(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'flymake-mode)
@end lisp

@item
The way the option @code{TeX-record-buffer} is used was corrected.  It
was used in just the opposite way as the document says.  Erase the
customization if you have customized this option since it now acts in
reverse to your expectation.

@item
A former customize option @code{japanese-TeX-command-list} is removed.
Use @code{japanese-TeX-engine-default}, or if it's really necessary,
customize @code{TeX-command-list} directly if the task which the option
used to carry is required.

@item
Support for standard @LaTeX{} without e-@TeX{} extension is now very
limited.  It doesn't work if raw @TeX{} code is put on the command line
to invoke @command{latex} command.  It also fails for region compilation (@kbd{C-c
C-r} and so on) with documents of non-ascii file name.  In addition, it
no longer works with @previewlatex{}.  We consider this incompatibility
is permissible because e-@TeX{} extension is enabled for standard
@LaTeX{} by default long ago.  @LaTeX{} variants such as Xe@LaTeX{} and
Lua@LaTeX{} are not affected.

@item
Key binds in Texinfo mode are improved.  Typing @kbd{$}, @kbd{^},
@kbd{_} and @kbd{\} now just self-inserts without pointless side effects
in Texinfo mode.

In addition, the option @code{TeX-electric-escape} is now effective in
Texinfo mode.  When it is enabled, typing @kbd{@@} will invoke
@code{TeX-electric-macro} offering completion in similar style with
other @TeX{} modes of @AUCTeX{}.

@item
Fontification support for @samp{biblatex} package is improved and
updated to macros provided by package version 3.12.  For qualified
lists, at least 2 mandatory arguments are fontified.

@item
Support for column specifiers @samp{w} and @samp{W} provided by
@samp{array} package is added to @file{array.el}.  The correct counting
of columns only works when the @samp{align} parameter is enclosed in
braces, e.g., @samp{w@{l@}@{3cm@}}.  The short version @samp{wl@{3cm@}}
is not supported.

@item
Entries for @samp{PDF Tools} are added in
@code{TeX-view-program-list-builtin} for Windows and macOS.  This viewer
can be configured under these operating systems with an entry like this
in an init file:
@lisp
(setq TeX-view-program-selection '((output-pdf "PDF Tools")))

@item
@AUCTeX{} now requires GNU Emacs 24 or higher.  Support for XEmacs has
been dropped.

@item
Besides the change in the supported version of Emacs, there has been no
functional change in this release, which is equivalent to version 11.92.
@end itemize

@heading News in 11.92

@itemize @bullet
@item
@previewlatex{} is compatible with Ghostscript 9.22 where the operator
@samp{.runandhide} is removed.  All occurrences of @samp{.runandhide} in
@previewlatex{} are replaced by alternative code making it work with
Ghostscript 9.22 again.

@item
@AUCTeX{} has a new customize option
@code{TeX-math-input-method-off-regexp}.  When you begin to input a math
formula, the current input method is turned off if its name matches this
regular expression.

In fact this variable was introduced long before, but has not been
documented in info files nor turned into a customize option with
@code{defcustom} until this release.

@item
The window system focus is pulled back to Emacs when viewing with
evince-compatible viewers if a new customize option
@code{TeX-view-evince-keep-focus} is non-@code{nil}.

@item
The usual dose of bug fixes was administered.
@end itemize

@heading News in 11.91

@itemize @bullet
@item
Now @AUCTeX{} has a logo.  The @LaTeX{} code to create it is available
in the @file{etc/} directory of the package.

@item
Add support for @command{upmendex}, an extension of @command{makeindex}
capable of sorting indexes by unicode based ICU.

@item
Fix @previewlatex{} to interact correctly with Japanese @LaTeX{}.  The
parsing routine was made robust not to be confused by the 7-bit encoding
of Japanese text and the necessary option to @LaTeX{} command is kept
even when preamble caching is enabled.

@item
The new ``Glossaries'' entry in @code{TeX-command-list} runs the command
@command{makeglossaries}.

@item
Fontification of control symbols has been improved.  Characters defined
in @code{font-latex-match-simple-exclude-list} do not receive any
fontification.  In Doc@TeX{} mode, the character @samp{_} is removed
from @code{font-latex-match-simple-exclude-list} in order to fontify
macros like @samp{\__module_foo:nnn} correctly.

@item
Fontification of math environments has been improved.  Optional and/or
mandatory argument(s) to environments are not fontified.

@item
@file{preview.sty} loads @file{luatex85.sty} if possible and should be
compatible with newer lua@TeX{} versions.

@item
@AUCTeX{} has a new customize option @code{TeX-ispell-verb-delimiters}.
This string contains usual characters used as delimiters for in-line
verbatim macros like @samp{\verb}.  Text between delimiters after an
in-line verbatim macro will be skipped during spell checking.

@item
Fontification of in-line verbatim macros has been improved.
@file{font-latex.el} recognizes an optional or a mandatory argument for
macros like @samp{\Verb} from @file{fancyvrb.sty}, @samp{\mint} and
@samp{\mintinline} from @file{minted.sty} and fontifies verbatim content
correctly.

@item
@AUCTeX{} can put and parse labels in optional argument of environments.
Inserting labels is done by new function
@code{LaTeX-env-label-as-keyval}.  A new customize option
@code{LaTeX-listing-label} is available as prefix to labels in code
typesetting environments, e.g.@: @samp{lstlisting} environment provided by
@samp{listings} package.  @code{LaTeX-listing-label} defaults to
@code{lst:}.  Parsing of labels for later referencing relies on two
requirements:
@enumerate
@item
Label should come as last key-value argument, and
@item
label must be enclosed in braces, e.g.
@example
\begin@{lstlisting@}[caption=Some Caption,label=@{lst:foo@}]
...
\end@{lstlisting@}
@end example
@end enumerate

@item
The function @code{LaTeX-label} now takes a second optional argument
@code{NO-INSERT}.  When non-@code{nil}, @code{LaTeX-label} reads a label
and returns it as a string.  This argument is also passed to any
function bound to @code{LaTeX-label-function} (see next item).

@item
@strong{Incompatible change:} The signature for the function passed with
the customize option @code{LaTeX-label-function} has changed.  The
function bound to this variable is now expected to take an optional
second argument @code{NO-INSERT}.  When this argument is non-@code{nil},
the function should read and only return a label as a string; insertion
is done by another function.

@item
Directory local variables were ineffective for
@code{japanese-latex-mode} and @code{japanese-plain-tex-mode}.  This bug
was fixed.  (This was actually done in @AUCTeX{} 11.90, but not
advertised)

@item
The output of Japanese text from Japanese @TeX{} engines is decoded
correctly for most cases, according to the encoding of the @TeX{}
documents and the locale.  The difference between MS Windows, macOS and
unix-like OS is taken into account.  (This was actually done in
@AUCTeX{} 11.90, but not advertised)

@item
Quite a few new @LaTeX{} packages are supported.

@item
As usual, many bugs were fixed.

@end itemize

@itemize @bullet
@item
In addition to the completion performed by @code{TeX-complete-symbol},
@AUCTeX{} now also supports the new Emacs standard completion-at-point
facility (see the Emacs command @code{completion-at-point}).  This also
means that modern completion UIs like @i{company-mode} work out of the
box in @TeX{} and @LaTeX{} buffers.
@ifclear rawfile
@xref{Completion}, for details.
@end ifclear

@item
Completion is now aware of being inside a math environment and then
completes math macros.

@item
@AUCTeX{} is able to display several levels of super- and subscripts,
each one raised above and a bit smaller than its basis.  For this
feature, have a look at the customize options
@code{font-latex-fontify-script} (especially the new values
@code{multi-level} and @code{invisible}) and
@code{font-latex-fontify-script-max-level}.  Also, the script characters
@samp{^} and @samp{_} are also fontified with a special face named
@code{font-latex-script-char-face}.
@ifclear rawfile
@xref{Fontification of math}, for details.
@end ifclear

@item
Parsing of format specification in various tabular environments has been
improved.  The function @code{LaTeX-insert-item} (@kbd{C-c @key{LFD}})
inserts suitable number of ampersands for @samp{*@{num@}@{cols@}}
constructs.  Style files for @LaTeX{} packages @samp{tabularx},
@samp{tabulary}, @samp{longtable}, @samp{dcolumn} and @samp{siunitx} are
adapted to take advantage of this improvement.

@item
@AUCTeX{} has a new Ispell dictionary @file{tex-ispell.el} for macros
and environments which will be skipped during spell checking.  The
activiation of this feature is controlled by a new customize option
@code{TeX-ispell-extend-skip-list}, which is set to @code{t} and
activated by default.

@item
@AUCTeX{} has a new customize option @code{TeX-raise-frame-function}
that is currently only used by Evince and Atril inverse search to raise
the Emacs frame.

@item
When inserting a new float, @AUCTeX{} will now prompt for a
short-caption if the length of the caption provided is greater than a
certain size.  This size is controlled via a new user option
@code{LaTeX-short-caption-prompt-length}.

@item
Parsing of the compilation log has been reworked.  You should encounter
fewer mistaken files while navigating through errors and warnings.

@item
Two new user options, @code{TeX-ignore-warnings} and
@code{TeX-suppress-ignored-warnings}, allow ignoring certain warnings
after compilation of the document.
@ifclear rawfile
@xref{Ignoring warnings}, for details.
@end ifclear

@item
A new option, @code{TeX-PDF-from-DVI}, controls if and how to produce a
@acronym{PDF} file by converting a @acronym{DVI} file.  This supersedes
@code{TeX-PDF-via-dvips-ps2pdf} which is still recognized but marked as
obsolete and may be removed in future releases.

@item
Support for a number of external viewers has been added:
@itemize
@item
Atril viewer.  Forward and inverse search requires version 1.9.1 or
later to work.

@item
dviout viewer on Windows.  Note that this setup works when
@code{TeX-source-correlate-method} is set to use @samp{source-specials}
for @acronym{DVI}, e.g.:
@lisp
(setq TeX-source-correlate-method
      '((dvi . source-specials)
        (pdf . synctex)))
@end lisp
which is the default.

@item
SumatraPDF viewer on Windows.

@item
Zathura viewer.  Forward and inverse search requires a recent version of
the program to work (3.4 or later).
@end itemize

@item
A new function, @code{TeX-documentation-texdoc}, for reading
documentation with @samp{texdoc} has been added.  @code{TeX-doc} is
still available but now @kbd{C-c ?} runs
@code{TeX-documentation-texdoc}.

@item
@AUCTeX{} has a new custom option
@code{LaTeX-reftex-cite-format-auto-activate} which controls the
automatic activation of citation formats provided by Ref@TeX{} when a style
file is loaded and Ref@TeX{} is enabled.  Currently, @file{biblatex.el},
@file{harvard.el}, @file{jurabib.el} and @file{natbib.el} use this
feature.  If you have customized @code{reftex-cite-format} and want to
use your settings, you should set this variable to @code{nil}.

@item
@AUCTeX{} now has limited support for the TikZ package.  For the moment,
this includes some basic support for prompting the user of arguments to
the @samp{\draw} macro.

@item
The style @file{graphicx.el} went through a bigger overhaul.  The
optional argument of command @samp{\includegraphics} now supports
key-val query; keys can independently be chosen anytime by pressing the
@key{,} key.  As a side effect, the variable
@code{LaTeX-includegraphics-options-alist} is now no-op and is removed
from @file{tex-style.el}.  You can safely remove any customization of it
from your init file.  The mandatory argument of @samp{\includegraphics}
knows about image file extensions supported by the used engine and
offers them for inclusion.

@item
Support for other @LaTeX{} packages was improved, and style files for
several new packages were added.

@item
Many bugs were crushed along the way.

Forward and backward search with Evince now also work when only a region
of the document is compiled/viewed.

@item
To open the PDF output file you can now use also PDF Tools, a document
viewer for Emacs.  With it, as a plus, forward and backward search is
accurate at word level.

@item
With new option @code{TeX-PDF-via-dvips-ps2pdf} it is possible to
compile a document to @acronym{DVI} and then convert it to @acronym{PDF}
using @command{dvips}--@command{ps2pdf} before viewing it.

@item
New option @code{TeX-file-line-error} allows to select file:line:error
style for error messages.

@item
Indent @samp{\[...\]} math mode as a regular environment by default.

Now @AUCTeX{} suggests to run @command{makeindex} when appropriate.

@item
@code{TeX-view-program-list} can contain, as third optional element of
each item, the name of the executable(s) needed to open the viewer.

@item
@code{TeX-expand-list} variable has been split into
@code{TeX-expand-list} and @code{TeX-expand-list-builtin}.  Only the
former is intended to be customized by the user, the latter contains
built-in expanders.  You might want to keep in @code{TeX-expand-list}
only new expansion strings.

@item
Before running commands like @TeX{} and @LaTeX{}, now @AUCTeX{} performs
some checks.  If @code{TeX-check-TeX} is non-@code{nil}, it will test
whether a working @TeX{} distribution is actually present in the system
and available to Emacs.  Instead, when @code{TeX-check-engine} is
non-@code{nil}, before running @LaTeX{} commands @AUCTeX{} will check
whether the correct engine has been set, based upon known restrictions
posed by @LaTeX{} packages.

@item
Basic support to @ConTeXt{} Mark IV has been added.  Users can now
select the Mark version to be used with new option
@code{ConTeXt-Mark-version}, and @AUCTeX{} is able to catch error
messages in the output log of a Mark IV document.

@item
Support for tons of @LaTeX{} packages has been added.

@item
Numbers of bugs have been fixed, many minor features have been added.

@code{TeX-parse-all-errors} is non-@code{nil}, which is the default.  When
this option is non-@code{nil}, an overview of errors and warnings reported

Style file authors are encouraged to distinguish common from expert
macros and environments, and mark the latter using

Users can then restrict completion using
@code{TeX-complete-expert-commands}.

@item
Management of @LaTeX{} package options in the parser was improved.  You
might need to reparse your documents, especially if you loaded the
@samp{babel} package with language options.

@item
Now you can insert @samp{$...$} or @samp{\(...\)} by typing a single
@kbd{$}.  To do this, customize the new option @samp{TeX-electric-math}.
@code{TeX-math-close-double-dollar} was removed.

classes is provided as well.

@item
New user options @code{LaTeX-default-author},
@code{LaTeX-fontspec-arg-font-search},
@code{LaTeX-fontspec-font-list-default}, @code{TeX-date-format}, and
@code{TeX-insert-braces-alist}.  A new possible value
(@code{show-all-optional-args}) for
@code{TeX-insert-macro-default-style} was added.  The default value of
@code{TeX-source-correlate-method} has been changed.

@item
@samp{biblatex} support was greatly expanded.  If parsing is enabled,
@AUCTeX{} looks at @samp{backend} option to decide whether to use Biber
or Bib@TeX{}.  The @code{LaTeX-biblatex-use-Biber} variable was changed to
be file local only and is no more customizable.

@item
With some @LaTeX{} classes, the default environment suggested by
@code{LaTeX-environment} (@kbd{C-c C-e}) when the current environment is
@samp{document} was changed.  With @samp{beamer} class the default
environment is @samp{frame}, with @samp{letter} it is @samp{letter},
with @samp{slides} it is @samp{slide}.

@item
Brace pairing feature was enhanced in @LaTeX{} documents.  Support for
@samp{\bigl}, @samp{\Bigl}, @samp{\biggl} and @samp{\Biggl}, the same
as the one for @samp{\left}, was added to @code{TeX-insert-macro}.
For example, @kbd{C-c @key{RET} bigl @key{RET} ( @key{RET}} inserts
@samp{\bigl(\bigr)}.

You can insert brace pair @samp{()}, @samp{@{@}} and @samp{[]} by typing
a single left brace if the new user option
@code{LaTeX-electric-left-right-brace} is enabled.

Macros @samp{\langle}, @samp{\lfloor} and @samp{\lceil}, which produce
the left part of the paired braces, are treated similarly as @samp{(},
@samp{@{} and @samp{[} during the course of @code{TeX-insert-macro}.

@item
Support for dozens of @LaTeX{} packages was added.

@item
Tabular-like environments (@samp{tabular}, @samp{tabular*}, @samp{tabularx}, @samp{tabulary}, @samp{array},
@samp{align}, ...) are indented in a nicer and more informative way when the
column values of a table line are written across multiple lines in the
tex file.

@item
The suitable number of ampersands are inserted when you insert @samp{array},
@samp{tabular} and @samp{tabular*} environments with @kbd{C-c C-e}.  Similar
experience is obtained if you terminate rows in these environments with
@kbd{C-c @key{LFD}}.  It supplies line break macro @samp{\\} and inserts
the suitable number of ampersands on the next line.

Similar supports are provided for various @samp{amsmath} environments.

@code{TeX-add-style-hook} has now a third argument to tell @AUCTeX{} for
which dialect (@LaTeX{}, Texinfo or Bib@TeX{}) the style hook is
registers. Labelling style hook by dialect will avoid applying them not

@item
@AUCTeX{} now supports Biber in conjunction with biblatex in addition to

@item
Each @AUCTeX{} mode now has its own abbrev table.  On Emacsen which
provide the possibility to inherit abbrevs from other tables, the
abbrevs from the Text mode abbrev table are available as well.  Newly
defined abbrevs are written to the mode-specific tables, though.

@item
The file @samp{tex-fptex.el} was removed.

@item
Forward/backward search for Evince has been improved.  If Emacs is
compiled with DBUS support and a recent Evince version (3.x) is
installed, the communication goes over the desktop bus instead of the
command line, resulting in more accurate positioning of point in Emacs
and highlighting of the target paragraph in Evince.

setting is now usually determined at runtime.

Due to this and other problems, @previewlatex{} in the released XEmacs
package failed under Windows or with anything except recent 21.5
XEmacsen.

@item
@AUCTeX{} and @previewlatex{} have been changed in order to accommodate
file names containing spaces.  @previewlatex{} now tolerates bad
PostScript code polluting the stack (like some Omega fonts).

@item
@samp{preview.sty} had in some cases failed to emit PostScript header
specials.

@item
Support for folding of comments was added.

activated with @code{TeX-toggle-debug-warnings} (@kbd{C-c C-t C-w}) or
@code{TeX-toggle-debug-bad-boxes} (@kbd{C-c C-t C-b}).  In this case
@code{TeX-next-error} will find these warnings in addition to normal
errors.

The key binding @kbd{C-c C-w} for @code{TeX-toggle-debug-bad-boxes}

@AUCTeX{} now can automatically insert a pair of braces after typing
@key{_} or @key{^} in math constructs if the new variable
@code{TeX-electric-sub-and-superscript} is set to a non-@code{nil} value.

@item
Some language-specific support for French was added.  There now is
completion support for the commands provided by the @samp{frenchb} (and
@samp{francais}) options of the babel @LaTeX{} package and easier input
of French quotation marks (@code{\og ...\fg}) which can now be

change @file{tex-mik.el} does not load @file{tex-site.el} anymore.  That
means if you used only @code{(require 'tex-mik)} in order to activate
@AUCTeX{}, you have to add @code{(load "auctex.el" nil t t)} before the
latter statement.

@end itemize

@heading News in 11.81

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{LaTeX-mark-section} now marks subsections of a given section as
well.  The former behavior is available via the prefix argument.

@item
@previewlatex{} which was previously available separately became a
subsystem of @AUCTeX{}.  There is no documented provision for building
or installing @previewlatex{} separately.  It is still possible to use
and install @AUCTeX{} without @previewlatex{}, however.

@item
The installation procedures have been overhauled and now also install
startup files as part of the process (those had to be copied manually
previously).  You are advised to remove previous installations of
@AUCTeX{} and @previewlatex{} before starting the installation
procedure.  A standard installation from an unmodified tarball no longer
requires Makeinfo or Perl.

Also note that the way @AUCTeX{} is supposed to be activated changed.
Instead of @code{(require 'tex-site)} you should now use @code{(load
"auctex.el" nil t t)}.  While the former method may still work, the new
method has the advantage that you can deactivate a preactivated
@AUCTeX{} with the statement @code{(unload-feature 'tex-site)} before
any of its modes have been used.  This may be important especially for
site-wide installations.

@item
Support for the babel @LaTeX{} package was added.

@item
Folding a buffer now ensures that the whole buffer is fontified before
the actual folding is carried out.  If this results in unbearably long
execution times, you can fall back to the old behavior of relying on
stealth font locking to do this job in the background by customizing the
variable @code{TeX-fold-force-fontify}.

@item
Folded content now reveals part of its original text in a tooltip or the
echo area when hovering with the mouse pointer over it.

@item
The language-specific insertion of quotation marks was generalized.  The
variables @code{LaTeX-german-open-quote},
@code{LaTeX-german-close-quote}, @code{LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote},
@code{LaTeX-italian-open-quote}, @code{LaTeX-italian-close-quote}, and
@code{LaTeX-italian-quote-after-quote} are now obsolete.  If you are not
satisfied with the default settings, you should customize
@code{TeX-quote-language-alist} instead.

@item
Similar to language-specific quote insertion, @AUCTeX{} now helps you
with hyphens in different languages as well.
@ifclear rawfile

@item
Fill problems in Japanese text introduced in @AUCTeX{} 11.55 were fixed.
@AUCTeX{} tries not to break lines between 1-byte and 2-byte chars.
These features will work in Chinese text, too.

@item
The scaling factor of the fontification of sectioning commands can now
be customized using the variable @code{font-latex-fontify-sectioning}.
This variable was previously called @code{font-latex-title-fontify}; In
this release we provide an alias but this will disappear in one of the
the next releases.  The faces for the sectioning commands are now called
@code{font-latex-sectioning-@var{N}-face} (@var{N}=0@dots{}5) instead of
@code{font-latex-title-@var{N}-face} (@var{N}=1@dots{}4).  Analogously
the names of the variables holding the related keyword lists were
changed from @code{font-latex-title-@var{N}-keywords} to

setting the variable @code{show-trailing-whitespace} to @code{t}.  If
you want to delete all trailing whitespace in a buffer, type @kbd{M-x

@item
On some systems the presence of an outdated Emacspeak package lead to
the error message @samp{File mode specification error: (error "Variable

prevent this error from happening.  But nevertheless, it is advised to
upgrade or uninstall the outdated Emacspeak package.

@item
The value of @code{TeX-macro-global} is not determined during
configuration anymore but at load time of @AUCTeX{}.  Consequently the
associated configuration option @option{--with-tex-input-dirs} was
removed.

Folding can now be done for paragraphs and regions besides single
constructs and the whole buffer.  With the new @code{TeX-fold-dwim}

added, @ref{Folding}.
@end ifclear

@item
You can now control if indentation is done upon typing @key{RET} by
customizing the variable
@ifset rawfile
@code{TeX-newline-function}.
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
@code{TeX-newline-function}, @ref{Indenting}.
@end ifclear

@item
Limited support for @code{doc.sty} and @code{ltxdoc.cls} (@samp{dtx}
files) was added.  The new doc@TeX{} mode provides functionality for
editing documentation parts.  This includes formatting (indenting and
filling), adding and completion of macros and environments while staying
in comments as well as syntax highlighting.  (Please note that the mode
is not finished yet.  For example syntax highlighting does not work yet
in XEmacs.)

@item
For macro completion in doc@TeX{} mode the @AUCTeX{} style files
@file{doc.el}, @file{ltxdoc.el} and @file{ltx-base.el} were included.
The latter provides general support for low-level @LaTeX{} macros and
may be used with @LaTeX{} class and style files as well.  It is
currently not loaded automatically for those files.

@item
Support for @ConTeXt{} with a separate @ConTeXt{} mode is now included.
Macro definitions for completion are available in Dutch and English.

@item
The filling and indentation code was overhauled and is now able to
format commented parts of the source syntactically correct.  Newly
available functionality and customization options are explained in the
manual.

@item
Filling and indentation in XEmacs with @previewlatex{} and activated
previews lead to the insertion of whitespace before multi-line previews.
@AUCTeX{} now contains facilities to prevent this problem.

@item
If @code{TeX-master} is set to @code{t}, @AUCTeX{} will now query for a
master file only when a new file is opened.  Existing files will be left
alone.  The new function @code{TeX-master-file-ask} (bound to @kbd{C-c
_} is provided for adding the variable manually.

@item
Sectioning commands are now shown in a larger font on display devices
which support such fontification.  The variable
@code{font-latex-title-fontify} can be customized to restore the old
appearance, i.e.@: the usage of a different color instead of a change in
size.

@item
Support for @code{alphanum.sty}, @code{beamer.cls}, @code{booktabs.sty},
@code{captcont.sty}, @code{emp.sty}, @code{paralist.sty},
@code{subfigure.sty} and @code{units.sty}/@code{nicefrac.sty} was added.
Credits go to the authors mentioned in the respective @AUCTeX{} style
files.

@item
Inserting graphics with @kbd{C-c @key{RET} includegraphics @key{RET}} was improved.
See the variable @code{LaTeX-includegraphics-options-alist}.
@c FIXME: Document this in the main part of the manual

@item
If @code{LaTeX-default-position} is @code{nil}, don't prompt for
position arguments in Tabular-like
@ifset rawfile
environments.
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
environments, see @ref{Tabular-like}.
@end ifclear

@item
Completion for available packages when using @kbd{C-c @key{RET} usepackage
@key{RET}} was improved on systems using the kpathsea library.

@item
The commenting functionality was fixed.  The separate functions for
commenting and uncommenting were unified in one function for paragraphs
and regions respectively which do both.

@item
Syntax highlighting can be customized to fontify quotes delimited by
either >>German<< or <<French>> quotation marks by changing the variable
@code{font-latex-quotes}.

@item
Certain @TeX{}/@LaTeX{} keywords for functions, references, variables
and warnings will now be fontified specially.  You may add your own
keywords by customizing the variables
@code{font-latex-match-function-keywords},
@code{font-latex-match-reference-keywords},
@code{font-latex-match-variable-keywords} and
@code{font-latex-match-warning-keywords}.

@item
If you include the style files @file{german} or @file{ngerman} in a
document (directly or via the @samp{babel} package), you should now
customize @code{LaTeX-german-open-quote},
@code{LaTeX-german-close-quote} and
@code{LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote} instead of @code{TeX-open-quote},
@code{TeX-close-quote} and @code{TeX-quote-after-quote} if you want to
influence the type of quote insertion.

@item
Upon viewing an output file, the right viewer and command line options
for it are now determined automatically by looking at the extension of
the output file and certain options used in the source file.  The
behavior can be adapted or extended respectively by customizing the
variable @code{TeX-output-view-style}.

@item
You can control whether @code{TeX-insert-macro} (@kbd{C-c @key{RET}}) ask for
all optional arguments by customizing the variable
@ifset rawfile
@code{TeX-insert-macro-default-style}.
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
@code{TeX-insert-macro-default-style}, @ref{Completion}.
@end ifclear

@item
@code{TeX-run-discard} is now able to completely detach a process that
it started.

@item
The build process was enhanced and is now based on @code{autoconf}
making installing @AUCTeX{} a mostly automatic process.  See
@ifset rawfile
the files @file{INSTALL} and @file{INSTALL.windows}
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
@ref{Installation} and @ref{Installation under MS Windows}
@end ifclear
for details.

@item
Changed name of @file{easymenu.el} to @file{auc-menu.el} to avoid
conflict with RMS's version.  Updated it to handle the Lucid
@code{:keys} keyword argument.  Defines a popup menu for both FSF and
Lucid emacs, although it is only installed in Lucid Emacs.  Added David

@item
Fixed problem with @file{filladapt} defeating @LaTeX{} mode's own
indentation algorithm.  Thanks to Piet van Oostrum
@samp{<piet@@cs.ruu.nl>}.

@item
Made environments and sections selectable from the menu bar.

@item
Support Emacs comment conventions.  Comments starting with a single
@samp{%} are indented at @code{comment-column}.  Comments starting with
@samp{%%%} are indented at column 0.  Comments starting with
@samp{%%} are indented like ordinary text.  You can set the variables
@code{LaTeX-right-comment-regexp} and @code{LaTeX-left-comment-regexp}
to nil to disable this.  See also @code{LaTeX-ignore-comment-regexp}.
Rewrote it from Christoph Wedler @samp{<wedler@@fmi.uni-passau.de>} from
original code.

@item
@key{tab} and @key{lfd} will not indent code in @samp{verbatim}
environment if you set @code{LaTeX-indent-environment-check} to non-nil.
This was also first implemented by Christoph Wedler
@samp{<wedler@@fmi.uni-passau.de>}.  

@item
You can now get get custom indentation for various environments.  See
@code{LaTeX-indent-environment-list}.

@item
@kbd{C-c C-m left @key{ret}} new automatically inserts a matching
@samp{\right}.  See variables @code{TeX-left-right-braces},
@code{TeX-braces-default-association}, and
@code{TeX-braces-user-association}.  This feature was suggested by Jesse
@samp{<jes@@math.msu.edu>} and implemented by Berwin Turlach
@samp{<berwin@@core.ucl.ac.be>}.

@item
Don't automatically display the compilation buffer unless
@code{TeX-show-compilation} in non-nil.  Suggested by Stefan Schoef
@samp{Stefan.Schoef@@arbi.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de}. 

@item
Bundled @file{ltx-help.el}.  Press @kbd{C-h C-l} to get the
documentation for a LaTeX command.

@item
Fixed indentation of @samp{\left} and @samp{\right}.  Thanks to
Christoph Wedler @samp{<wedler@@fmi.uni-passau.de>}.

@item
Installation procedure changed.  @file{tex-site.el} is now intended to
survive AUC @TeX{} upgraded.  The distribution version only contains
autoloads (eliminating the need for @file{tex-load.el} , the
customization variables are moved to @file{tex.el}.  You should copy
those variables you need to customize from @file{tex.el} to
@file{tex-site.el}. 

@item
Made it possible to use absolute paths when including bibliographies or
style files.

@item
Fixed problem with parsing errors after running @LaTeX{} on the region
from the menu.  Thanks to Peter Barth @samp{<barth@@mpi-sb.mpg.de>} for
finding this one.

@item
The file @file{doc/ref-card.texi} has been renamed to
@file{doc/tex-ref.texi} to avoid confusion with the reference card for
GNU Emacs.  Suggested by Michelangelo Grigni @samp{<mic@@cs.ucsd.edu>}.

@item
The @file{README}, @file{CHANGES} and @file{INSTALLATION} files are now
generated from chapters of this manual, to ensure they stay in sync.

@item
@kbd{M-@key{tab}} will now complete some macro arguments in addition to
macro names.  In particular, if you press @kbd{M-@key{tab}} after
@samp{\cite@{} or @samp{\ref@{} you will get completion for bibitems and
labels, respectively.

@item
Merged a number of files.  The major files are now @file{tex.el} for
plain @TeX{} and common support, @file{tex-buf.el} for running external
commands, and @file{latex.el} for @LaTeX{} support.

@item
Unbundled @file{outln-18.el}.  Users of Emacs 18 or Lucid Emacs 19.9 or
earlier must get @file{outln-18.el} and install it as @file{outline.el}
if they want the outline commands to work.

@item
No longer bind @kbd{C-c @key{tab}} to @code{TeX-complete-symbol}.  Use
@kbd{M-@key{tab}} instead.

@item
Cleaned up the parser and parameterizedd it.  Now you can add now types
of information to be maintained by the parser simply by calling
@code{TeX-auto-add-type}.  You still need to install the regexps with
@code{TeX-auto-add-regexp}. 

@item
Disable the automatic insertion of empty braces after macros with no
arguments in @code{LaTeX-math-mode}.  Added a variable
@code{TeX-insert-braces} to disable it everywhere. 

@item
Now complete with existing labels when asking for a label in a @LaTeX{}
environment.  Suggested by Berwin Turlach
@samp{<berwin@@core.ucl.ac.be>}.
 
@item
The variables @code{TeX-private-macro}, @code{TeX-private-auto}, and
@code{TeX-private-style} are now initialized from the @samp{TEXINPUTS}
and @samp{BIBINPUTS} environment variables.
 
@item
@kbd{C-c C-f} and @kbd{C-c C-e} will now put the template around the
region if the region is active.

@item
Fixed @kbd{C-u C-c C-e} to handle environments ending with a star
(@samp{*}).  Reported by Berwin Turlach
@samp{<berwin@@core.ucl.ac.be>}.

@item
Don't use @code{with-output-to-temp-buffer} for compilation buffer.
Fixed by Frederic Devernay @samp{<Frederic.Devernay@@sophia.inria.fr>}.

@item
New function @code{TeX-command-buffer} (@kbd{C-c C-b}) to run a command
on the (visible part of) the current buffer.  Requested by several
people. 

@item
Bundled the latest @file{reporter.el}, added
@code{TeX-submit-bug-report} to menus.

@item
@code{TeX-insert-braces} now takes an argument like
@code{insert-parentheses}.  Thanks to Lawrence R. Dodd
@samp{<dodd@@roebling.poly.edu>}. 

@item
Fixed bug in @samp{\put} and @samp{\multiput} macros.  Thanks to Kevin
Scott @samp{<scottkj@@prl.philips.co.uk>}.

@item
Deleted @code{ams-latex-mode}, @code{slitex-mode}, and
@code{foiltex-mode}.  Instead, use @code{LaTeX-command-style} to
determine the name of the external command to use.

@item
Deleted @code{latex2e-mode}.  Instead set the @code{LaTeX-version}
variable.  This may be done automatically if you use
@samp{\documentclass} in the future.

@item
Fixed Lucid Emacs menu for @TeX{}info mode.  Thanks to Frederic Devernay
@samp{<Frederic.Devernay@@sophia.inria.fr>},

@item
Added support for @file{harvard.sty} by Berwin Turlach
@samp{<berwin@@core.ucl.ac.be>}.

@item
Filling will not let display math equations @samp{\[ ... \]} be on a
line by themselves.  Reported by Matthew Morley
@samp{<Matthew.Morley@@gmd.de>}. 

@item
Made @code{words-include-escapes} default to nil.  

@item
Made @code{TeX-expand-list} expansions case sensitive.  Thanks to Havard
Rue @samp{<Havard.Rue@@sima.sintef.no>}.

@item
Fixed error in calculating indentation for lines starting with a brace.
Thanks to Piet van Oostrum @samp{<piet@@cs.ruu.nl>}.

@item
Fixed bug in the @samp{addcontentsline}, @samp{newtheorem}, and
@samp{pagenumbering} macros reported by Berwin Turlach
@samp{<berwin@@core.ucl.ac.be>}.

@item
Doc fixes by Lawrence R. Dodd @samp{<dodd@@roebling.poly.edu>}.

@item
Indentation no longer fooled by @samp{\\@{},  Thanks to Peter Thiemann
@samp{<thiemann@@provence.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de>}.

@item
Bind @kbd{M-C-e} and @kbd{M-c-a} to @code{LaTeX-find-matching-end} and
@code{LaTeX-find-matching-begin}.  Suggested by Lawrence R. Dodd
@samp{<dodd@@roebling.poly.edu>}.

@item
Added variable @code{TeX-quote-after-quote} which causes
@code{TeX-insert-quote} to insert literal @samp{"} except when after
another @samp{"}, in which case it will expand to @code{TeX-open-quote}
or @code{TeX-close-quote}.  This code was contributed by Piotr Filip
Sawicki @samp{<pfs@@mimuw.edu.pl>}.

@item
Added support for Polish style files @file{plfonts.sty} and
@file{plhb.sty}, contributed by Piotr Filip
Sawicki @samp{<pfs@@mimuw.edu.pl>}.

@item
Added section with suggestions for how to handle European
character sets.

@item
Created workaround for bug in the regexp handler in some Emacs 18
versions and older versions of Lucid Emacs.  The workaround
means you cannot use space in the documentstyle command in Emacs and
Lucid Emacs earlier than version 19.9.

@item
@file{powerkey.el} is removed since the functionality is integrated in
GNU Emacs 

@item
@kbd{C-u "} now inserts four literal @samp{"}, not just one.  To insert
a single @samp{"} either press @key{"} twice or use @kbd{C-q "}.

@item
Allow non-string value for @code{outline-minor-map-prefix}.  Reported by
David Smith @samp{<maa507@@comp.lancs.ac.uk>}.

@item
Make the use of @code{write-file-hooks} more safe, and use
@code{local-write-file-hooks} when possible.  Suggested by David Smith
@samp{<maa507@@comp.lancs.ac.uk>}.

@item
Don't indent @samp{\begin@{verbatim@}} and @samp{\end@{verbatim@}},
since any space before @samp{\end@{verbatim@}} is significant.  Thanks to
Peter Thiemann @samp{<thiemann@@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de>} for the
patch.

@item
Show available fonts when you try to insert an non-existing font.
Suggested by David Smith @samp{<maa507@@comp.lancs.ac.uk>}.

@item
The @code{member} function in @file{tex-18.el} does not depend on
@code{TeX-member} now.  Thanks to Piet van Oostrum
@samp{<piet@@cs.ruu.nl>}. 

@item
Do not overwrite any global binding of @kbd{M-@kbd{ret}}.  Suggested by
Jens Petersen @samp{<J.Petersen@@qmw.ac.uk>}.

@item
Major modes for writing text are supposed to rebind @kbd{M-@kbd{tab}} to
@code{ispell-complete-word}.  Reported by Jens Petersen
@samp{<J.Petersen@@qmw.ac.uk>}.

@item
Fixed problems with @TeX{}info menus.  Thanks to David Smith
@samp{<maa507@@comp.lancs.ac.uk>} for reporting this.

@item
Code cleanup.   Removed the @file{format} directory, as it did not make
it easier to add new @TeX{} modes, quite the contrary.

@item
Fixed name conflict in @file{auc-tex.el}, reported by Rik Faith
@samp{<faith@@cs.unc.edu>}. 

@item
Fixed some spelling errors.  Thanks to Lawrence R. Dodd
@samp{<dodd@@roebling.poly.edu>}. 

@item
Fixed bug prohibiting non-standard file extensions.  Now recognize
@file{.ltx} by default.  Suggested by Lawrence R. Dodd
@samp{<dodd@@roebling.poly.edu>}. 

@item
Name of the AUC @TeX{} info files changes once again to be usable under
DOS.  This time simply to @file{auctex}.

@item
Documented @code{TeX-outline-extra}.

@item
Could not select command on region from the menu before loading
@file{tex-buf}.  Reported by Uwe Bonnes
@samp{<bon@@lte.e-technik.uni-erlangen.de>}.

@item
Make the hilit19 interface more robust.  Thanks to William Dean Norris
II @samp{<wdn@@dragonfly.cis.ufl.edu>}.

@item
More OS/2 Makefile fixes by Bodo Huckestein
@samp{<bodo@@eu10.mpi-hd.mpg.de>}.

@item
Reimplemented comment support on top of @code{comment-region}, giving
slightly different semantics.

@item
Makefile now works under OS/2 with GNU Make.  Thanks to Bodo Huckestein

@item
Made it possible to install global auto files without having Bib@TeX{}
mode installed.  Thanks to Christian Lynbech
@samp{<lynbech@@daimi.aau.dk>}.

@item
Minor documentation fixes.  Thanks to Martin Maechler
@samp{<maechler@@stat.math.ethz.ch>}.

@item

Peter Whaite @samp{<peta@@cim.mcgill.ca>}.

@item 
Use @samp{-c} as the default shell command option under @samp{emx}.
Eberhard Mattes @samp{<mattes@@azu.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de>} says
it is better than @samp{/c}.

@item
Made powerkey in the menus work better under OS/2.  Thanks to Eberhard

@item
Made the reference cards print correctly on US letter format paper.
Thanks to Magnus Nordborg @samp{<magnus@@fisher.Stanford.EDU>}.

@item
@code{LaTeX-dead-mode} removed.  Read the file `ISO-TEX' for alternative
solutions.

@item
All minor modes unbundled.  You can find them from ftp at
@samp{ftp.iesd.auc.dk} in the directory @file{/pub/emacs-lisp}.  Removed
information about minor modes from this document.

@item
New hooks for changing ispell directory, see @file{tex-site.el} for
details.  

@item 
@LaTeX{}2e mode now supported.  Insert 

@lisp
  (setq TeX-default-mode 'latex2e-mode)
@end lisp

in your @file{.emacs} file to get documentclass instead of documentstyle
per default.  The parser recognizes documentclass, usepackage, and
newcommand with a default argument.  There are also templates for all of
them.

@item
Added Jakob Schiotz's @samp{<schiotz@@fysik.dth.dk>} help file for
installing AUC @TeX{} on OEMACS.  It will probably also be of interest
for DEMACS users.

@item
Minor changes to be more friendly for OEMACS, thanks to Jakob Schiotz
@samp{<schiotz@@fysik.dth.dk>}. 

@item
The control key bindings in @code{LaTeX-math-mode} now works, thanks to
Frederic Devernay @samp{<Frederic.Devernay@@sophia.inria.fr>}. 

@item
@LaTeX{} outlines no longer matches @samp{\partial} or other commands
with a sectioning command as prefix.  Thanks to Jakob Schiotz
@samp{<schiotz@@fysik.dth.dk>}.

@item
@code{LaTeX-fill-paragraph} now handles the case where the previous line
both contain an @samp{\item} and an unmatched open brace.  Thanks to
Piet van Oostrum @samp{<piet@@cs.ruu.nl>}.

@item
Use abbreviated file name for @TeX{} output buffers in Emacs 19.  Thanks
to Jens Gustedt @samp{<gustedt@@math.tu-berlin.de>}.

@item
Added lowercase alias for @code{LaTeX-math-mode} for use with Emacs file
mode commands.  Thanks to Olaf Burkart
@samp{<burkart@@zeus.informatik.rwth-aachen.de>}. 

@item
Added code to reuse old region in @code{TeX-command-region} if mark is
not active.  Thanks to Cengiz Alaettinoglu @samp{<ca@@cs.UMD.EDU>}.

@item
Now get keyboard accelerators on all menus rather than only AUC @TeX{}
menus, thanks to the @file{powerkey.el} file by Lars Lindberg
@samp{<lli@@sypro.cap.se>}.

@item
Added @code{TeX-electric-macro} for faster completion of @TeX{} macros.
@xref{Completion}.

@item
Comparing printer names are now case incentive.  Thanks to Richard
Stanton @samp{<stanton@@haas.berkeley.edu>}.

@item
Default shell fixed for OS/2.  Thanks to Richard Stanton
@samp{<stanton@@haas.berkeley.edu>}.

@item
Added functions to hide (@code{LaTeX-hide-environment}) and show
(@code{LaTeX-show-environment}) the current environment.

@item
@kbd{C-u C-c C-e} will now modify the current environment instead of
inserting a new environment.  This is like the optional argument to the
font commands.

@item
Added nabla to LaTeX Math Mode.  Suggested by Bill Reynolds
@samp{<bill@@goshawk.lanl.gov>}. 

@item
Added commands for running @TeX{} and @LaTeX{} interactively.  Thanks to
David Carlisle @samp{<carlisle@@computer-science.manchester.ac.uk>}.

@item
The external commands will now insert there output @emph{before} point
in the output buffers.  This allows you to follow the progress by
putting point at the end of the file.  Suggested by Jak Kirman
@samp{<jak@@cs.brown.edu>}.

@item
When invoking an external command from a menu, the document will be
automatically saved. 

@item
There are now a printer menu for emacs 19.

@item
Redesigned dependency checking.  Now only checks dependencies for files
loaded in the current emacs session.  This is much faster, but will not
catch files that are edited outside this emacs session, or files edited
in killed buffers.  @strong{@code{TeX-check-path} must at least contain
@file{.} for saving to work}.  If you have set @samp{TeX-check-path}
in your @file{.emacs} file, remove it.  The default value is fast enough
now.

@item
New variable @code{TeX-save-query} control if AUC @TeX{} will query you
for each modified buffer when you save the document.  Set it to nil to
get rid of these questions.  Setting this variable also affect the
automatic saving of the document that happens each time you start an
external command.

@item
New command @code{TeX-save-document} will save all files in the current
document, i.e. the document associated with the current buffer.

@item 
Cleaned up all minor modes, also made them use @file{min-map.el} or
@file{min-mode.el} instead of @file{min-bind.el}.

@item
Cleaned up release management.

@item
AUC TeX will not longer be confused when you rewrite a file under a new
name. 

@item
Lots of code cleanup, involving reformatting the source and renaming all
@samp{-hook} variables and functions to conform with the Emacs 19
guidelines. 

@item 
Can now parse Japanese characters in labels and macros when you use
Japanese @TeX{}.  Thanks to Shinji Kobayashi
@samp{<koba@@flab.fujitsu.co.jp>}.

@item 
Made it safe to quit when AUC @TeX{} asks for the name of the master
file.  It will simply assume the file itself is the master, and continue
without inserting any file local variables.

@item
Support for @code{epsf} and @code{psfig} style files.  Thanks to Marc
Gemis @samp{<makke@@wins.uia.ac.be>}.

@item
Support for @LaTeX{}info.  Thanks to Marc Gemis
@samp{<makke@@wins.uia.ac.be>}.

@item
Only examine the first 10000 bytes to find out what @TeX{} mode to use.

@item 
Added @code{TeX-submit-bug-report} command to submit bug reports.  It
uses the @file{reporter.el} distributed with SuperCite, so it may not be
available in some Emacs 18 installations.

@item
Speeded up parsing significantly by using a simpler regexp.

@item
Added variable @code{TeX-auto-untabify}.  Set it to nil to prevent
untabifying the buffer when it is saved.  Several people wanted this. 

@item
Changed defaults to @emph{not} do any automatic parsing, nor prompt for
a master file.  @xref{Parsing Files}, @ref{Multifile}, for information
about how ot correct this.  In short, insert the following in your
@file{.emacs} file.

@lisp
(setq TeX-auto-save t)
(setq TeX-parse-self t)
(setq-default TeX-master nil)
@end lisp

@item
Some grammatical fixes to the @file{PROBLEMS} file.  Thanks to Lawrence
R. Dodd @samp{<dodd@@roebling.poly.edu>}.

@item
No longer install a separate @code{outline-minor-mode} by default, as
the FSF Emacs 19.19 @code{outline-minor-mode} is adequate.  The included
file @file{outln-18.el} emulates the FSF Emacs 19.19 mode under Emacs 18.

The FSF Emacs 19.19 @code{outline-minor-mode} use the @kbd{C-c} prefix
instead of @kbd{C-c C-o} by default, and does not bind as many keys as
the @code{outline-minor-mode} distributed with earlier versions of AUC
@TeX{} did.  You can get the keybindings back together with other
goodies by inserting
@example
(require 'out-xtra)
@end example
in your @file{.emacs} file.  @file{out-xtra.el} will probably be
unbundled from AUC @TeX{} in the future.

@item
Some fixes to AmS-@TeX{} mode by Ulf Juergens
@samp{<ulf@@mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de>}.

@item
Make @samp{plain-TeX-mode-menu} work in Lucid Emacs.  Thanks to Anthony
Rossini @samp{rossini@@hsph.harvard.edu} for reporting this.

@item
First cut on a @TeX{}info mode.

@item
More strict about parsing @samp{\bibitem}'s and Bib@TeX{} entries.

@item
Made it easier to write style files for environments that takes
arguments and documented it.  Suggested by Martin
Wunderli @samp{<wunderli@@inf.ethz.ch>}.

@item
Parse optional argument to @samp{\newenvironment}.  Suggested by Martin
Wunderli @samp{<wunderli@@inf.ethz.ch>}.

@item
Fixed @samp{parbox} macro.  Thanks to Shinji Kobayashi
@samp{<koba@@flab.fujitsu.co.jp>}.

@item
Made the parser work better in outline minor mode.  Thanks to Salvador
Pinto Abreu @samp{<spa@@khosta.fct.unl.pt>}.

@item
Also save style information with @code{TeX-normal-mode} when buffer not
modified.

@item
Use @code{$(MAKE)} instead of @samp{make} to invoke @code{make} from the
@file{Makefile}.  Thanks to John Interrante
@samp{<interran@@uluru.Stanford.EDU>}. 

@item
Make last value default for @code{TeX-insert-macro}.  Suggested by Matt
Fairtlough @samp{<M.Fairtlough@@dcs.sheffield.ac.uk>}.

@item
Renamed info file to @samp{auc-info} in order to fill DOS file limits.
Please remember to update your @file{dir} file to reflect this change.

@item
Delete auto file instead of saving an empty file.

@item
More robust installation, especially for Lucid Emacs (I hope).  Many
people reported problems with this.

@item
Make `easymenu' work when byte-compiled.  Many people reported this
bug.

@item
Minimally updated the @file{README} file from version 6.0 (sigh).
Thanks to Boris Goldowsky @samp{<boris@@cs.rochester.edu>} for reporting
this.

@item
Added @samp{@@finalout} to manual.  Reported by Henrik Drabol
@samp{<hvd@@ens004.ens.min.dk>}.

@item
Fixed @kbd{M-q} to work after an @samp{\end@{@dots{}@}}.  It will not
work at the end of the buffer, but there are usually the local variables
so it should (hopefully) not matter.  Thanks to Shinji Kobayashi
@samp{<koba@@flab.fujitsu.co.jp>} again.

@item
New variables @code{TeX-open-quote} and @code{TeX-close-quote} determine
what is inserted by @code{TeX-insert-quote}.  The @file{german} style
file now use those variables instead of changing the keymap.

@item
Changes to the default settings in @file{tex-site.el}, in particular a

@item
New keymap. 

The keymap has been changed in order to make it more intuitive to new
users, and because the old bindings did not work well with the new
buffer manipulation commands in tex-buf.el.  To use the new bindings,
load @file{tex-init.el} instead of @file{auc-tex.el}.

The file @file{auc-tex.el} is still available and implements the old
keybindings on top of the new code.

Print out the reference card (@file{doc/tex-ref.tex}) to see the new
bindings.  

@item
Completely redesigned the buffer handling. 

No part of the interface or the customization variables remain the same,
unless you use the compatibility functions in @file{auc-tex.el}.  In
that case the interactive commands remain similar in spirit, but the
customization interface is still changed. 

The file @file{tex-buf.el} has been completely rewritten, and there are
major cleanup in @file{tex-dbg.el}, however the basic functionality
remains the same in this file.  The code for both @file{tex-buf.el} and
@file{tex-dbg.el} should be much simpler now and easier to extent.

@file{auc-tex.el} and @file{tex-site.el} was updated to support the new
interface.  I actually believe the moral equivalent to @code{TeX-region}
to work now @t{:-)}, at least I understand the code now.

The two major functions are now @code{TeX-command-master} and
@code{TeX-command-region}.  Each function will prompt you for the
command to execute.  AUC @TeX{} will make an educated guess on what
command you want to run, and make that the default.  The available
commands are defined in the variable @code{TeX-command-list}.

@code{TeX-command-master} will run the specified command on the buffers
master file.  You can have one command running for each master file.
@code{TeX-command-region} will run the specified command on the current
region, getting the header on trailer from the master file.  

You can have exactly one region command running, independent on how many
master file commands that are running.  Commands that operate on the
active process (like @code{TeX-next-error}) will chose the process
associated with buffers master file, unless the last region process is
more recent than all master file processes.

AUC @TeX{} now insist on knowing the master file for a buffer.  If you
do not specify it in the file variable section, and it is not obviously
a master file itself, it will ask you.  It will also add the master file
name to the file variables, unless you disable this feature by setting
@code{TeX-add-local} to nil.  Furthermore, it will convert @samp{%%
Master:} lines to file variables, unless you disable it by setting
@code{TeX-convert-master} to nil.
@vindex TeX-convert-master

Functionality removed (for now, it might appear again latter) include
all other functions to start a command (e.g. @code{LaTeX-BibTeX}), and
alternative ways to specify headers and trailers.  The only place to get
the header and trailer is from the master file (I can easily change
that, if anyone have such needs).

@item
Style specific code isolated.

You can now add style specific information to AUC TeX by writing a
style file somewhere in TeX-style-path.

The main code is now organized around this principle.

@item
Automatically generate style files.

AUC @TeX{} can now automatically extract information from a @TeX{} file,
and will do this when you save a buffer.

@item
Sli@TeX{} mode.

Just like @LaTeX{} mode, except that the default command to format run
on the buffer is @samp{slitex}.

@item
@code{LaTeX-section} completely general.

Rewrote @file{ltx-sec.el}.

@end itemize

@item
@code{TeX-insert-macro} much smarter.

It will now prompt for the symbol with completions, and for many symbols
it will also prompt for each argument.  There are also completion on
some of the arguments.

@item
Fixed center in figure environment. 

Thanks to Thomas Koenig @samp{<ig25@@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>}.

@item
Changed @code{\M-} to @code{\e} in all keybindings in order to better
support 8-bit input on some GNU Emacs. Thanks to Peter Dalgaard
@samp{<pd@@kubism.ku.dk>}.

Please, implementors of 8-bit input extensions to GNU Emacs.
@code{\M-x} does @emph{not} means @dfn{@kbd{x} with the 8-bit set}.  It
means @dfn{pressing @kbd{x} while holding down the @key{meta} key}.
Some systems (such as X11) are able to tell the different.  Thus, even
if you implement 256 byte keymaps, @code{\M-x} should still expand
@code{meta-prefix-char} followed by an @kbd{x} in the keymap.  This
allows you to distinguish pressing @kbd{x} while holding down the
@key{meta} key from entering a literal 8-bit character.

@item
Made the outline commands aware of the document style.

That is, if the document style is @samp{article}, @samp{\section} will
be one level below the @samp{\documentstyle}, while if the style is
@samp{book}, @samp{\section} will be three levels below
@samp{\documentstyle}.  This will make @code{show-children} work better
at the top level.

@item
The makefiles are closer to GNU coding standard.

They now understand `prefix' and some other macros.

@item
Added hooks to be run after list of environments or list of completion
names are updated, and also added a hook to be called after each file
has been loaded. Thanks to Piet van Oostrum @samp{<piet@@cs.ruu.nl>}.

@item
Added @samp{*} to lot of @code{(interactive)} declarations.

@item
The outline commands are now always accessible from @LaTeX{} mode.

@item
Generalized the keyboard remapping and double modes.

These are found in the file @file{min-key.el}. 

@item
Smart Comments.

Not really, but there are now two comment functions which use their
arguments to determine what to do, instead of four functions ignoring
their arguments.

@item
Add outline headers.

It is now possible to add extra outline headers, by setting the variable
@code{TeX-outline-extra}. 

@item 
Smart quotes even smarter.

If you press @kbd{"} twice, it will insert an real double quote instead
of two (or four) single quotes.  This is consistent with how remapping
in @file{min-key.el} is done.

@item
Automatically untabify buffer when you save it.

Hands up, everyone who have produced a `last revision' paper containing
an unreadable list of data in the back, because @TeX{} does not
understands tabs.

@item
Call show-all when you change major mode.

Thanks to Inge Frick's @samp{<inge@@nada.kth.se>} @file{kill-fix.el}
enhancement, outline minor mode can now guarantee that all text is shown
when you leave the minor mode, even if you leave the minor mode by
changing the major mode.

@section Ancient History

The origin of AUC @TeX{} is @file{tex-mode.el} from Emacs 16.  Lars
Peter Fischer @samp{<fischer@@iesd.auc.dk>} wrote the first functions to
insert font macros and Danish characters back in 1986.  Per Abrahamsen
@samp{<abraham@@iesd.auc.dk>} wrote the functions to insert environments
and sections, to indent the text, and the outline minor mode in 1987.
Kresten Krab Thorup @samp{<krab@@iesd.auc.dk>} wrote the buffer handling
and debugging functions, the macro completion, and much more, including
much improved indentation and text formatting functions.  He also made
the first public release in 1991, and was the main author and
coordinator of every release up to and including 6.0.

Thanks should also go to all the people who have been a great help
developing the AUC @TeX{} system.  Especially all the people on the
@samp{auc-tex} mailing list, who have been very helpful commenting and
pointing out weak points and errors.
