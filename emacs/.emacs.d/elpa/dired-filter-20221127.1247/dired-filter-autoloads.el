Create a filter NAME.

Files matched by the predicate are kept in the listing.

For filters where the reverse behaviour makes more sense as
default, you can set the `:remove' argument to `t' to flip the
truth value by default.  Do not flip the value in the predicate
itself!

DOCUMENTATION is the documentation of the created filter.

BODY should contain forms which will be evaluated to test whether
or not a particular file should be displayed or not.  The forms
in BODY will be evaluated with FILE-NAME bound to the file name,
and QUALIFIER bound to the current argument of the filter.
During the evaluation point is at the beginning of line.

:description is a short description of this filter (usually one
or two words).

:reader is a form that is used by `interactive' to read optional
argument.  If not specified or nil, the filter does not accept
argument from user.

:qualifier-description is a form to format qualifier for display.

:remove reverses the default matching strategy of the filter.

Toggle filtering of files in Dired.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Dired-Filter mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive,
enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `dired-filter-mode'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.

When you toggle the filter mode, the filter stack and all other
state is preserved, except the display is not altered.  This
allows you to quickly toggle the active filter without need of
popping the stack and then re-inserting the filters again.
