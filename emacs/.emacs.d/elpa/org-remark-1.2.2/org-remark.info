1.1 Basic Setup
===============

After installation, we suggest you put the setup below in your
configuration.

     (org-remark-global-tracking-mode +1)

     ;; Optional if you would like to highlight websites via eww-mode
     (with-eval-after-load 'eww
       (org-remark-eww-mode +1))

     ;; Optional if you would like to highlight EPUB books via nov.el
     (with-eval-after-load 'nov
       (org-remark-nov-mode +1))

     ;; Optional if you would like to highlight Info documentation via Info-mode
     (with-eval-after-load 'info
       (org-remark-info-mode +1))

‘org-remark-global-tracking-mode’ automatically turns on
‘org-remark-mode’ when you open a file, website via EWW, EPUB book via
nov.el, or other supported buffer that has a marginal notes file
associated with it.  This is useful to keep the location of your
highlights correct across Emacs sessions after you shutdown Emacs.

Unless you explicitly load ‘org’ during Emacs initialization, we suggest
to defer loading ‘org-remark’ (thus there is no ‘(require 'org-remark)’
in the example above).  This is because it will also pull in ‘org’,
which can slow down initialization.  You can control the timing of
loading ‘org-remark’ by autoloading some commands in a similar way with
the example keybindings below.

Below are example keybindings you might like to consider:

     ;; Key-bind `org-remark-mark' to global-map so that you can call it
     ;; globally before the library is loaded.

     (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c n m") #'org-remark-mark)
     (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c n l") #'org-remark-mark-line) ; new in v1.3

     ;; The rest of keybidings are done only on loading `org-remark'
     (with-eval-after-load 'org-remark
       (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n o") #'org-remark-open)
       (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n ]") #'org-remark-view-next)
       (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n [") #'org-remark-view-prev)
       (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n r") #'org-remark-remove)
       (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n d") #'org-remark-delete))


File: docd6Y1XY.info,  Node: Setup with use-package,  Prev: Basic Setup,  Up: Installation

1.2 Setup with ‘use-package’
============================

Alternatively, you can use ‘use-package’ to set up Org-remark.  The
example provided below should be equivalent to the setup described
above.

     (use-package org-remark
       :bind (;; :bind keyword also implicitly defers org-remark itself.
              ;; Keybindings before :map is set for global-map.
              ("C-c n m" . org-remark-mark)
              ("C-c n l" . org-remark-mark-line) ; new in v1.3
              :map org-remark-mode-map
              ("C-c n o" . org-remark-open)
              ("C-c n ]" . org-remark-view-next)
              ("C-c n [" . org-remark-view-prev)
              ("C-c n r" . org-remark-remove)
              ("C-c n d" . org-remark-delete))
       ;; Alternative way to enable `org-remark-global-tracking-mode' in
       ;; `after-init-hook'.
       ;; :hook (after-init . org-remark-global-tracking-mode)
       :init
       ;; It is recommended that `org-remark-global-tracking-mode' be
       ;; enabled when Emacs initializes. Alternatively, you can put it to
       ;; `after-init-hook' as in the comment above
       (org-remark-global-tracking-mode +1)
       :config
       (use-package org-remark-info :after info :config (org-remark-info-mode +1))
       (use-package org-remark-eww  :after eww  :config (org-remark-eww-mode +1))
       (use-package org-remark-nov  :after nov  :config (org-remark-nov-mode +1)))

2.1 Highlighting and Annotating
===============================

Once you have installed and set it up (*note Installation::), Org-remark
is simple to use.  Select a part of text and call ‘M-x org-remark-mark’
to highlight it.  You will see the selected text gets highlighted.  This
is a range-highlight.  With the new version 1.3, you can also highlight
a whole line in addition to a range of text by calling
‘org-remark-mark-line’.  Visually, instead of adding a highlight to the
line, it will add a mark on the margin of the buffer (the left margin is
the default and you can customize it with
‘org-remark-line-margin-side’).  This is a line-highlight.  Both the
range- and line-highlights behave the same way except for how they
appear in the buffer you are editing or viewing.  You can mix them in
the same buffer as you see fit for your purposes.

The menu bar item “Org-remark” is available when you turn on
‘org-remark-mode’.  It helps you discover Org-remark’s main commands.
If you use Emacs version 28 or newer, a context menu is also available
by right-clicking your mouse.  Turn on the Emacs built-in
‘context-menu-mode’ to enable the context menu.

To display the marginal notes for the highlight you have just marked,
place your cursor on the highlight and call ‘M-x org-remark-open’ or
‘M-x org-remark-view’.  This will create a new buffer to the left of the
current buffer you are editing.  You can customize where the marginal
notes buffer is to be placed (see the documentation of customizing
variable ‘org-remark-notes-display-buffer-action’).

The ‘open’ command takes the cursor to the marginal notes buffer for you
to edit notes; the ‘view’ command keeps the cursor in the current buffer
only to display the marginal notes.  Both commands narrow the *marginal
notes file* to the entry for the highlight under the cursor.  The
marginal notes file is a normal Org file.  Edit your notes just as you
would do with any other Org files and save the buffer.


File: docd6Y1XY.info,  Node: Navigating from One Highlight to Another,  Next: Create Your Own Highlighter Pens,  Prev: Highlighting and Annotating,  Up: Getting Started

2.2 Navigating from One Highlight to Another
============================================

After you have added a couple of highlights in the text, you can move
through the highlights easily.  Use ‘org-remark-view-next’ and
‘org-remark-view-prev’ to browse the marginal notes as you move from one
highlight to another.  They display the marginal notes on the
side-window by default.  Or use ‘org-remark-next’ and ‘org-remark-prev’
if you simply want to move to the next/previous highlight without
displaying marginal notes for them.

To make navigation easy, you can use define the same “prefix key” to
Org-remark commands like this:

   • ‘C-c n o’: ‘org-remark-open’
   • ‘C-c n ]’: ‘org-remark-view-next’
   • ‘C-c n [’: ‘org-remark-view-prev’
   • ‘C-c n r’: ‘org-remark-remove’
   • ‘C-c n d’: ‘org-remark-delete’

The ‘C-c n’ part is the prefix key common to all of them.  If you set
the keybindings like this, you can use ‘C-c n ]’ once to view the next
highlight and keep pressing a single key ‘]’ or ‘[’ to browse through
the next/previous highlights.  After you have reached the one you like
to act on, press ‘o’ to open it, ‘r’ or ‘d’ to remove/delete it.

2.3 Create Your Own Highlighter Pens
====================================

Org-remark has a default highlighter pen function, and comes with a set
of two additional pens by default:

‘org-remark-mark’
     default highlighter pen
‘org-remark-mark-line’
     default line-highlighter pen, which adds a mark on the margin
     instead of a range of text
‘org-remark-mark-yellow’
     yellow highlight with “important” category in the marginal notes
     entry
‘org-remark-mark-red-line’
     wavy red underline with “review” category in the marginal notes
     entry and “Review this” in tool-tips

Org-remark lets you create your own custom pen functions with
‘org-remark-create’.  Use the yellow and red line pens as examples, and
create your own.  For how to do it, *note How to Create Custom
Highlighter Pens::.

This is all you need to get started.  For more detail, refer to the rest
of this user manual, especially *note Usage: Usage Features Concepts.
and *note Customizing:: sections.  There is more to the commands
introduced in this section and more ways in which you can customize
Org-remark.

2.4 Highlight and Annotate Websites
===================================

‘org-remark-eww-mode’ lets you highlight and annotate websites just like
text files.  It is a global minor mode.  It does not require any
additional configuration.  All you need is to turn it on, visit a
website with ‘eww-mode’, and select text and highlight it.  Refer to the
example of a basic setup given in *note Installation::.  Org-remark can
attempt to automatically adjust the position of highlights when a
websites get edited.  Lear more about the feature in *note What is
Automatic Adjustment of Highlight Positions?::

2.5 Highlight and Annotate EPUB Books
=====================================

‘org-remark-nov-mode’ lets you highlight and annotate EPUB books just
like text files.  It is a global minor mode.  It does not require any
additional configuration.  All you need is to turn it on, open a EPUB
book with ‘nov-mode’, and select text and highlight it.  Refer to the
example of a basic setup given in *note Installation::.  If you read
books with tables, it is useful to learn about the feature that
automatically adjust the highlight positions: *note What is Automatic
Adjustment of Highlight Positions?::

2.6 Highlight and Annotate Info documentation in ‘Info-mode’
============================================================

‘org-remark-info-mode’ lets you highlight and annotate Info
documentation just like text files.  It is a global minor mode.  It does
not require any additional configuration.  All you need is to turn it
on, open an Info node with ‘Info-mode’, and select text and highlight
it.  Refer to the example of a basic setup given in *note
Installation::.

3.1 How to Create Custom Highlighter Pens
=========================================

‘org-remark-create’ is a macro that lets you create your own custom pen
functions.  Org-remark comes with two additional pens that are created
by default.  Use them as examples to learn how to create your own.

     (org-remark-create "red-line"
                        '(:underline (:color "dark red" :style wave))
                        '(CATEGORY "review" help-echo "Review this"))
     (org-remark-create "yellow"
                        '(:underline "gold" :background "lemon chiffon")
                        '(CATEGORY "important"))

Macro: ‘org-remark-create’ label &optional face properties
     Create and register new highlighter pen functions.  The newly
     created pen function will be registered to variable
     ‘org-remark-available-pens’.  It is used by ‘org-remark-change’ as
     a selection list.

     ‘LABEL’ is the name of the highlighter and mandatory.  The function
     will be named ‘org-remark-mark-LABEL’.

     The highlighter pen function will apply ‘FACE’ to the selected
     region.  ‘FACE’ can be an anonymous face.  When ‘FACE’ is nil, this
     macro uses the default face ‘org-remark-highlighter’.

     ‘PROPERTIES’ is a plist of pairs of a symbol and value.  Each
     highlighted text region will have a corresponding Org headline in
     the notes file, and it can have additional properties in the
     property drawer from the highlighter pen.  To do this, prefix
     property names with “‘org-remark-’” or use “‘CATEGORY’”.

As of version 1.3, you can use ‘org-remark-create’ to create a new
line-highlighter pen.  Use the ‘PROPERTIES’ parameter like the example
below to specify ‘org-remark-type’ to be ‘line’.  This tells Org-remark
to create a line-highlighter pen function instead of a default
range-highlighter one.  The ‘LABEL’ does not need to include the string
“line”, but it is recommended for consistency with the default command
‘org-remark-mark-line’.

     ;; This creates a custom command named org-remark-mark-line-alt with
     ;; face diff-hunk-header
     (org-remark-create "line-alt"
                      'diff-hunk-header
                      '(org-remark-type line))

     NOTE: Don’t use ‘category’ (all lowercase, symbol) as a property –
     it’s a special one for text properties.  If you use it, the value
     also need to be a symbol; otherwise, you will get an error.  You
     can use ‘CATEGORY’ (all uppercase, symbol), which will result in
     adding ‘CATEGORY’ with the value in the property drawer in marginal
     notes Org files.

3.2 How to Automatically Turn On Highlights after Re-starting Emacs
===================================================================

It is recommended that ‘org-remark-global-tracking-mode’ be turned on as
part of your Emacs initialization.  This should be done before you start
adding highlights in any file.

Once you have added highlights to some files, quit Emacs, and re-start
it, active ‘org-remark-global-tracking-mode’ will automatically turn on
‘org-remark-mode’ and load the highlights from your previous sessions
for the files being globally tracked.

Without this global minor mode, you would need to remember to activate
‘org-remark-mode’ for each file where you add highlights and annotation.
This is often unpractical.

3.3.1 Marginal Notes File
-------------------------

When you mark a part of text with a highlighter pen function, Org-remark
will automatically create a *marginal notes file*.  By default, it will
be named ‘marginalia.org’ and created in the same directory as the file
you are editing (*note How to Change Where Marginal Notes File is
Saved:: *note ;Customizing: Customizing, ‘org-remark-notes-file-name’).

The important thing to note is that Org-remark uses following properties
in the property drawer of the headline to remember the highlights:

   • :org-remark-beg:
   • :org-remark-end:
   • :org-remark-id:
   • :org-remark-label:

Essentially, the marginal notes file is a database in the plain text
with using Org mode.  As a plain text database, you can easily edit
these properties manually if necessary.  You can directly edit the
marginal notes file as a normal Org file.

The marginal notes file stores highlights and notes like this below; it
is designed to organize highlights and notes for multiple files and
multiple highlights (You are free to change the default headline titles
Org-remark automatically inserts.  Refer to section *note Organize
Headlines in Marginal Notes Buffer in Your Way::).

     * File 1
     ** Highlight 1 in File 1
     ** Highlight 2 in File 1
     [...]
     * File 2
     ** Highlight 1 in File 2
     [...]

You can leave the marginal notes file as it is without writing any
notes.  In this case, the entries in marginal notes file simply save the
locations of your highlighted text.  After you quit Emacs, re-start it,
and visit the same source file, Org-remark uses this information to
highlight the text again.

In addition to the properties above that Org-remark reserves for itself,
you can add your own custom properties and ‘CATEGORY’ property.  Use
“org-remark-” as the prefix to the property names (or “CATEGORY”, which
is the only exception), and Org-remark put them to the property drawer
of highlight’s headline entry in the marginal notes buffer.  Define the
custom properties in your own custom pen functions (for how to create
your own pens, *note How to Create Custom Highlighter Pens::).


File: docd6Y1XY.info,  Node: Organize Headlines in Marginal Notes Buffer in Your Way,  Next: *marginal-notes* Buffer,  Prev: Marginal Notes File,  Up: How to Manage Marginal Notes

3.3.2 Organize Headlines in Marginal Notes Buffer in Your Way
-------------------------------------------------------------

When you highlight a range of text or a line, Org-remark creates a
corresponding headline in the marginal notes buffer with using Org mode.
By default, the headline’s title is either the selected text for the
range-highlight or the first 40 characters of the line for the
line-highlight.  For the latter, if the string is longer than the
maximum characters, it will be truncated and replaced by an ellipsis
“…”.  Both the 40 character maximum length and the ellipsis can be
customized with customizing variables
‘org-remark-line-heading-title-max-length’ and
‘org-remark-line-ellipsis’ respectively.

These are only default initial headline titles and you are free to
change them as you see fit.  For example, you may add a line-highlight
to the line where you define a function in an Emacs Lisp script file.
The initial title of the corresponding headline in the marginal notes
buffer will be something like this below.

     ** (defun name-of-the-function (arg)...)
      :PROPERTIES:...
      I will revisit this function later.

It may make sense to change this to something like this, especially if
you would prefer to organize marginal notes as ‘TODO’ items so as to
show the headlines in your agenda.

     ** TODO review name-of-the-function
      :PROPERTIES:...
      I will revisit this function later.


File: docd6Y1XY.info,  Node: *marginal-notes* Buffer,  Next: How to Change Where Marginal Notes File is Saved,  Prev: Organize Headlines in Marginal Notes Buffer in Your Way,  Up: How to Manage Marginal Notes

3.3.3 ‘*marginal-notes*’ Buffer
-------------------------------

When you display the marginal notes with ‘org-remark-view’ or
‘org-remark-open’ for a given highlight, Org-remark creates a cloned
indirect buffer visiting the marginal notes file.  By default, it is a
dedicated side-window opened to the left part of the current frame, and
it is named ‘*marginal notes*’.  You can change the behavior of
‘display-buffer’ function and the name of the buffer (*note
Customizing::).

Org-remark displays the marginal notes buffer narrowed to the highlight
the cursor is on.

After all the properties, you can freely write your notes for the
highlight.  Once you save the notes buffer, an excerpt of the text
(currently up to 200 characters) gets updated back onto the highlight in
the source buffer.  You can hover your mouse over the highlight to see
the excerpt displayed in the echo area (bottom of the screen) of Emacs.
If you have ‘tooltip-mode’ mode turned on, the excerpt is displayed as a
took tip for the highlight.

3.3.4 How to Change Where Marginal Notes File is Saved
------------------------------------------------------

The location of the marginal notes file is specified by user option
‘org-remark-notes-file-name’ and its default is “marginalia.org”.  This
means the marginal notes file will reside in the same directory as the
source files as a separate file.

If you use the ‘customize’ command to customize
‘org-remark-notes-file-name’, you will have an option to choose a ‘File’
or ‘Function’ (customization group ‘org-remark’).  The default is ‘File’
with the default “marginal.org” as noted above.  Use a string to specify
the single file name; you can specify a relative path like the default
or an absolute path.

If you would like to dynamically change the location based on the file
and various different conditions, select the function as an option.  The
default function is ‘org-remark-notes-file-name-function’.  It adds
‘-notes.org’ as a suffix to the source file’s name without the
extension.  For example, for a file named ‘my-source-file.txt’,
Org-remark will store highlights in ‘my-source-file-notes.org’.  You can
create your own function and use it.

Some examples and use cases are listed below:

Store Marginal Notes in the Source File
     In order to use the source file also as the marginal notes file
     (storing the notes in the source file), you can set the built-in
     function ‘buffer-file-name’ as the value of
     ‘org-remark-notes-file-name’.  Note that you will need to ensure
     that the source files are an Org file.

Create a marginal notes file for each source file and store all of them in a specific location
     Create a custom function that returns an absolute file name per
     source file, and set ‘org-remark-notes-file-name’ to the function
     name.  It might look like this:

          (defun my/function ()
            (concat "~/path/to/note-files/"
                    (file-name-base (org-remark-notes-file-name-function))
                    ".org"))

          (setq org-remark-notes-file-name
                #'my/function)

3.3.5 How to Use Relative or Absolute File Names for Links in Marginal Notes File
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The marginal notes file stores the file name pointing back at source
files.  For example, a marginal notes entry for File1.txt might look
like this example below.

     * File 1
     :PROPERTIES:
     :org-remark-file: path/to/File1.txt
     :END:
     ** Highlight 1 in File 1
     :PROPERTIES:
     :[...other-properties]:
     :org-remark-link: [[file:path/to/File1.txt::14]]
     :END:

The level-1 headline named “File 1” records the file name of the source
file ‘path/to/File1.txt’.  Similarly, the level-2 headline named
“Highlight 1 in File 1” stores the link pointing back at the source file
and the line number of the highlight.

As you can see, both file names use a relative file name from the
marginal notes file.  This is the default setting of
‘org-remark-source-file-name’.

You can customize the variable to use absolute file names, or to use a
function of your choice.  The function is called with a single argument:
the absolute file name of source file.  The ‘default-directory’ is
temporarily set to the directory where the marginal notes file resides.
If you choose to use relative file names, the relative path is computed
from ‘default-directory’.


File: docd6Y1XY.info,  Node: How to Remove and Delete Highlights,  Next: What is Automatic Adjustment of Highlight Positions?,  Prev: How to Manage Marginal Notes,  Up: Usage Features Concepts

3.4 How to Remove and Delete Highlights
=======================================

You can remove the highlight under the cursor with command
‘org-remark-remove’.  This command does not delete the corresponding
entry in the marginal notes file.  This is intentional; Org-remark is
conservative when it deletes anything that the user might have edited.

If you wish to delete the entry and the highlight at the same time, pass
a universal argument to ‘org-remark-remove‘ (e.g.  by adding ‘C-u’
before ‘M-x org-remark-remove’) or use ‘org-remark-delete’.
‘org-remark-delete’ is identical with adding ‘C-u’ to
‘org-remark-remove’.

The delete function will prompt for confirmation if it detects any notes
present in the corresponding entry for the highlight in question in the
marginal notes buffer.

     NOTE: Note that you can undo the deletion or removal *in the
     marginal notes buffer* – not in the source buffer where you mark
     text with a highlighter.  Technically, highlights are overlays and
     are therefore not part of the undo tree in the source buffer.

As of version 1.3, you can use a new optional feature, automatic
deletion.  When the feature is enabled, Org-remark will automatically
delete the highlight’s headline when you delete text that includes a
highlight, provided there is no marginal notes for it.  If marginal
notes are present for the highlight’s headline, Org-remark only removes
the highlight, deleting the properties from the highlight headline –
same operation as ‘org-remark-remove’.  Your marginal notes will be kept
intact.  In either case, Org-remark does not ask for your confirmation.

You can enable it with the new user option
‘org-remark-notes-auto-delete’ like this example below.

     (setopt org-remark-notes-auto-delete :auto-delete)

Furthermore, with v1.3, if you pass a universal argument to
‘org-remark-delete’ (e.g.  ‘C-u M-x org-remark-delete’) you can manually
get Org-remark to do automatic deletion for the highlight at point.  You
can also pass double universal arguments to ‘org-remark-remove’ (e.g.
‘C-u C-u M-x org-remark-remove’) for the same operation.  This should
make sense because passing a single universal argument to
‘org-remark-remove’ is the same as ‘org-remark-delete’.  Refer to the
documentation of the customizing variable
‘org-remark-notes-auto-delete,’ the functions ‘org-remark-remove’ and
‘org-remark-delete’.

3.5 What is Automatic Adjustment of Highlight Positions?
========================================================

Org-remark by default attempts to automatically adjust the position of
highlights when they are loaded.  This is useful especially for EPUB
books read by nov.el.  It renders tables in different sizes depending on
the available space of the window to maximize their readability.

This is a good feature for reading; however, it also changes the
positions of subsequent text elements depending on the window size when
the page is rendered.  It can result in dislocating the positions of
highlights, different from they are originally created.

Org-remark attempts to automatically corrects the highlights dislocated.
This is a general feature so Org-remark attempts to correct minor edits
to websites (for EWW).

More technically, it works as follows.

  1. When you create a new highlight, Org-remark records the original
     text highlighted in the Org property named
     “‘org-remark-original-text’”.

  2. Next time when you open a new file (EPUB book as an example),
     Org-remark loads the highlights from the notes Org buffer.

  3. For each highlight, it compares the currently highlighted text with
     the value of ‘org-remark-original-text’ property.

  4. If they are the same, Org-remark does nothing.

  5. If different, Org-remark by default looks for the same text string
     +- two paragraphs.  When it finds the *first* matching text string,
     it automatically moves the highlight to the matched text string.

  6. Org-remark adds an icon to the auto-adjusted highlight to make it
     clear that the position of highlight has been adjusted.

  7. This adjustment is temporary.  If you prefer to change the position
     permanently, you can do so by manually changing the
     ‘org-remark-beg’ and ‘org-remark-end’ properties in the notes
     buffer and save.  You can also choose to alter the value of
     ‘org-remark-original-text’ if you have adjusted the range of
     highlighted text.

You can customize the icon itself and its face with the following
customizing variables:

   • Option: ‘org-remark-icon-position-adjusted’
   • Face: ‘org-remark-highlighter-warning’

3.6 How to Set Org-remark to Use SVG Icons
==========================================

As of v1.2, highlights can display an icon.  With this option, you can
customize Org-remark to visually indicate that marginal notes exist for
them instead of the default ASCII string “(*)”, or to indicate that the
Org-remark has automatically adjusted the highlight position (default
ASCII string “(d)”; refer to *note What is Automatic Adjustment of
Highlight Positions?::).

There are mainly two ways to set up SVG icons.

  1. Use the new built-in ‘icons‘ library available as of Emacs version
     29.1
  2. Create a custom function and use a third-party library such as
     ‘svg-lib’ (https://github.com/rougier/svg-lib) by Nicolas Rougier

Below is a quick guide on the first option to use the built-in library

  1. Get or create an SVG icon
  2. Put the downloaded SVG file somewhere in your local
  3. Use define-icon macro to create an icon with the SVG file

First, create or download an icon as an ‘.svg’ file.  For example,
Boxicons (https://boxicons.com/) has a collection of SVG icons, which
are provided under The MIT License (https://boxicons.com/usage#license).
Second, place the SVG file in your local directory, e.g.
‘~/.config/emacs/.cache/svg/bx-pen.svg’.  And finally, use ‘define-icon’
to define the icon in your configuration like this example below.

     (define-icon annotation nil
     '((image "~/.config/emacs/.cache/svg/bx-pen.svg"
              :height (0.8 . em)))
     "Notes svg icon for Org-remark"
     :version 29.1)

Now the icon has been defined, you can set it to customizing variable
‘org-remark-icon-notes’ like so:

     ;; This example uses `setopt' that is made available as of 29.1. `setq' works too.
     (setopt org-remark-icon-notes (icon-string 'annotation))

If you have a buffer with highlights already open, use ‘revert-buffer’
to reload the highlights.  You should see the icon you have defined
instead of the default “(*)” string.


File: docd6Y1XY.info,  Node: Other Commands,  Prev: How to Set Org-remark to Use SVG Icons,  Up: Usage Features Concepts

3.7 Other Commands
==================

Command ‘org-remark-toggle’
     Toggle showing/hiding of highlights in current buffer.  If you
     would like to hide/show the highlights in the current buffer, it is
     recommended to use this command instead of ‘org-remark-mode’.  This
     command only affects the display of the highlights and their
     locations are still kept tracked.  Toggling off ‘org-remark-mode’
     stops this tracking completely, which will likely result in
     inconsistency between the marginal notes file and the current
     source buffer.

Command ‘org-remark-change’
     Change the highlight at point to one by another pen.  This command
     will show you a list of available pens to choose from.

To navigate through highlights in the current buffer, you can use
‘org-remark-view-next’ / ‘org-remark-view-prev’ or the following pair of
commands.  The former moves your cursor and displays the marginal notes
buffer; the latter only moves your cursor.

Command ‘org-remark-next’
     Move to the next highlight, if any.  If there is none below the
     point but there is a highlight in the buffer, cycle back to the
     first one.  After the point has moved to the next highlight, this
     command lets you move further by re-entering only the last letter
     like this example: ‘C-n ] ] ] ] ]’ (assuming this command is bound
     to C-n ])

Command ‘org-remark-prev’
     Move to the previous highlight, if any.

4 Customizing
*************

Org-remark’s user options are available in the customization group
‘org-remark’.

Face: ‘org-remark-highlighter’
     Default face for ‘org-remark-mark’

Option: ‘org-remark-create-default-pen-set’
     When non-nil, Org-remark creates default pen set.  Set to nil if
     you prefer for it not to.

Option: ‘org-remark-notes-file-name’
     Name of the file where we store highlights and marginal notes.  It
     can be either a string or function.  If it is a string, it should
     be a file name to the marginal notes file.  The default is
     ‘marginalia.org’.  The default will result in one marginal notes
     file per directory.  Ensure that it is an Org file.  If it is a
     function, the default function is
     ‘org-remark-notes-file-name-function’.  It returns a file name like
     this: ‘FILE-notes.org’ by adding ‘-notes.org’ as a suffix to the
     file name without the extension.

Option: ‘org-remark-notes-display-buffer-action’
     Buffer display action that Org-remark uses to open marginal notes
     buffer.

Option: ‘org-remark-notes-buffer-name’
     Buffer name of the marginal notes buffer.  ‘org-remark-open’ and
     ‘org-remark-visit’ create an indirect clone buffer with this name.

Option: ‘org-remark-source-file-name’
     Function that returns the file name to point back at the source
     file.  The function is called with a single argument: the absolute
     file name of source file.  The ‘default-directory’ is temporarily
     set to the directory where the marginal notes file resides.  This
     means that when the ‘Relative file name’ option is selected, the
     source file name recorded in the marginal notes file will be
     relative to it.

Option: ‘org-remark-use-org-id’
     When non-nil, Org-remark adds an Org-ID link to marginal notes.
     The link points at the relevant Org-ID in the source file.
     Org-remark does not create this ID, which needs to be added
     manually or some other function to either the headline or file.

Option: ‘org-remark-icon-notes’
     It’s the icon used to indicate that a given highlight has its
     associated notes entry.  The default is a combination of ASCII
     characters to be compatible with terminal and others.  If it is
     preferred, you can set an emoji to it.  The author has not
     experienced well with icon fonts and other means of displaying
     graphic elements.  The face of the icon becomes the same as the
     highlight, thus it does not have its own face definition.

     By setting it to ‘nil’, you can disable the icon altogether.

     ‘org-remark-toggle’ also toggles the icon along with the highlight

     Option: ‘org-remark-icon-position-adjusted’ : It’s the icon used to
     indicate that the position of a given highlight has been
     automatically adjusted by Org-remark.  The default is a combination
     of ASCII characters to be compatible with terminal and others.  If
     it is preferred, you can set an emoji to it.  The author has not
     experienced well with icon fonts and other means of displaying
     graphic elements.

     By setting it to ‘nil’, you can disable the icon altogether.

     ‘org-remark-toggle’ also toggles the icon along with the highlight

Face: ‘org-remark-highlighter-warning’
     This face is used by the icon to indicate that the position of a
     given highlight has been adjusted.  To know more about the feature
     itself, refer to *note What is Automatic Adjustment of Highlight
     Positions?::.

Option: ‘org-remark-open-hook’
     Hook run when a note buffer is opened/visited.  It gets run with no
     additional argument but the current buffer will become the note
     buffer.

Option ‘org-remark-highlights-after-load-functions’
     Abnormal hook run after Org-remark loads the highlights from the
     note org buffer.  It is run with OVERLAYS and NOTES-BUF as
     arguments.  OVERLAYS are highlights.  It is run with the source
     buffer as current buffer.  This hook is used by the automatic
     adjustment feature.  To know more about the feature itself, refer
     to *note What is Automatic Adjustment of Highlight Positions?::.

4.1 Customizing Line Highlights
===============================

These are user options for line highlights available as of v1.3.  They
are listed in customizing group ‘org-remark-line’.

Face: ‘org-remark-line-highlighter’
     Face for the default line highlighter pen.

Option: ‘org-remark-line-icon’
     Glyph displayed on the margin to indicate the line-highlight.  You
     can set an SVG icon to it.  Refer to *note How to Set Org-remark to
     Use SVG Icons::.

Option: ‘org-remark-line-minimum-margin-width’
     Margin width in a natural number.  It can be a single number or a
     cons cell of two.  When it is a single number, both the left and
     right margin widths will be the
same.  When this customizing variable is a cons cell, the format is as
follows: (LEFT-MARGIN-WIDTH .  RIGHT-MARGIN-WIDTH).

Option: ‘org-remark-line-margin-padding’
     Padding between the main text area the glyph/icon on the margin.

Option: ‘org-remark-line-margin-side’
     The side of margin to display line highlights.
Left or Right can be chosen.

Option: ‘org-remark-line-heading-title-max-length’
     Maximum length of string included as the highlight title.

Option ‘org-remark-line-ellipsis’
     Ellipsis used when the highlight title is longer than maximum.
The maximum is set in ‘org-remark-line-heading-title-max-length’.

5 Known Limitations
*******************

No export together with the source file
     There is no out-of-the-box feature to export marginal notes
     together with the source file.  Nevertheless, the marginal notes is
     a normal Org file, thus if the source file is also an Org file, you
     could use the built-in ‘include’ feature, for example, to include
     relevant parts of the marginal notes into the export output.

Copy & pasting loses highlights
     Overlays are not part of the kill; thus cannot be yanked.

Undo highlight does not undo it
     Overlays are not part of the undo list; you cannot undo
     highlighting.  Use ‘org-remark-remove’ or ‘org-remark-delete’
     commands instead.

Moving source files and marginal notes files
     Moving your files and remark file to another directory does not
     update the source paths and file names stored in the marginal notes
     file.  One way to keep the links between the source files and
     marginal notes files is to use relative file names with
     ‘org-remark-source-file-name’ (default).

With ‘org-remark-eww-mode’ highlights can get displaced
     This happens when the website is edited and its content changes
     outside Emacs – of course this is normal for websites.  Currently
     there is no way to fix the location of highlights.

6 Credits
*********

To create this package, I was inspired by the following packages.  I did
not copy any part of them, but borrowed some ideas from them – e.g.
saving the margin notes in a separate file.

Ov-highlight (https://github.com/jkitchin/ov-highlight)
     John Kitchin’s (author of Org-ref).  Great UX for markers with
     hydra.  Saves the marker info and comments directly within the Org
     file as Base64 encoded string.  It uses overlays with using ‘ov’
     package.

Annotate.el (https://github.com/bastibe/annotate.el)
     Bastian Bechtold’s (author of Org-journal).  Unique display of
     annotations right next to (or on top of) the text.  It seems to be
     designed for very short annotations, and perhaps for code review
     (programming practice); I have seen recent issues reported when
     used with variable-pitch fonts (prose).

Org-annotate-file (https://github.com/tkf/org-mode/blob/master/contrib/lisp/org-annotate-file.el)
     Part of Org’s contrib library.  It seems to be designed to annotate
     a whole file in a separate Org file, rather than specific text
     items.

InPlaceAnnotations (ipa-mode) (https://github.com/IdoMagal/ipa.el)
     It looks similar to Annotate.el above.

Transient navigation feature
     To implement the transient navigation feature, I liberally copied
     the relevant code from a wonderful Emacs package, Binder
     (https://github.com/rnkn/binder/blob/24d55db236fea2b405d4bdc69b4c33d0f066059c/binder.el#L658-L665)
     by Paul W.  Rankin (GitHub user rnkn (https://github.com/rnkn)).

Appendix D GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <https://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
