Version 1.0.0
  - chg: align with GNU convention: path -> file name

         Regarding user option `org-remark-notes-file-path`, the GNU convention
         is to call this a "file name" rather than a "path"; "path" is only used
         for lists of directories as in `load-path` (pointed out by Stefan
         Monnier; thank you).

         To align with the GNU convention, the following changes are done.
         Users should not have to change their existing customization as the old
         names are aliased to the new ones.

         User option:
         - org-remark-notes-file-path -> org-remark-notes-file-name
         - org-remark-source-path-function -> 'org-remark-source-file-name

         Function:
         - org-remark-notes-file-path-function -> org-remark-notes-file-name-function

         Private Function:
         - org-remark-notes-get-file-path -> org-remark-notes-get-file-name

         `org-remark-notes-file-path`, `org-remark-source-path-function`, and
         `org-remark-notes-file-path-function` are used by existing
         customization, thus both explicitly made obsolete and aliased to the
         new file-name equivalents.

  - fix: Relative file name of the source file in the notes file

         The relative file name of the source was not relative from the marginal notes
         file but from the source file itself -- this should be relative from the
         marginal notes.

  - chg: `org-remark-global-tracking-mode' has been simplified.

         This is not expected to break the user's workflow or configuration
         -- simply removing a superfluous feature.

         .org-remark-tracking file is no longer necessary and can be safely
         deleted from the user's Emacs configuraiton directory if present.
         Automatic activation of `org-remark-mode' is done by looking the
         presence of a marginal notes file for current buffer open.

         `org-remark-global-tracking-mode' itself is still relevant and
         recommended to be setup as was previously in the user manual.

  - add: Option to use relative links from the marginal notes back to the source

         Adding user option org-remark-source-path-function.  The default is
         file-relative-name.

  - add: Adding a new option to org-remark-notes-file-path to use a function

         Its default function is org-remark-notes-file-path-function.  It
         returns a file name like this: "FILE-notes.org" by adding
         "-notes.org" as a suffix to the file name without the extension.

         time

* Changes

  - chg: `remove' (and delete) only removes one highlight at a time instead of
         remove all at point

  - chg: Save marginal notes on `mark' instead of wainting for `save'

  - chg: define org-remark-mark explicitly for autoload cookie

  - chg: `org-remark-view' and `org-remark-open'. View will stay in the
          current main note; open will move the cursor to the marginal notes
          buffer for further editing.

  - chg: When updating the existing headline and position properties, don't
         update the headline text when it already exists. Let the user decide
         how to manage headlines.
