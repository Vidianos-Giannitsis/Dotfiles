;;; Commentary:

;; The content of this file is now (December 2023) part of latex.el
;; and font-latex.el.  This style provides only completion for xparse
;; package options.

;; The "yet not more supported" specifiers `l', `u', `g' and `G' are
;; ignored completely and may lead to wrong parsing results.

;;; Code:

(require 'latex)

(defvar LaTeX-xparse-package-options-list
  '(("log-declarations" ("true" "false")))
  "Package options for the xparse package.")

(defun LaTeX-xparse-package-options ()
  "Read the xparse package options from the user."
  (TeX-read-key-val t LaTeX-xparse-package-options-list))

;;; xparse.el ends here
