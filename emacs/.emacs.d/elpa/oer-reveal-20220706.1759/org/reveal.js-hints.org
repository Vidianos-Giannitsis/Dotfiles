Presentations are generated with
[[https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal][emacs-reveal]]
and make use of the HTML presentation framework
[[https://revealjs.com/][reveal.js]].

- Key bindings and navigation
  - Press “?” to see key bindings of reveal.js
  - In general, “n” and “p” move to next and previous slide; mouse
    wheel works as well
  - Up/down (swiping, arrows) move within sections,
    left/right jump between sections (type “o” to see what is where)
  - Type slide’s number followed by Enter to jump to that slide
  - Browser history (may need /two/ attempts to work)
  - Zoom with Ctrl-Mouse or Alt-Mouse
  - Search with Ctrl-Shift-F (press “enter” for subsequent search hits)
  - Since August 2021, presentations use the ~linear~
    [[https://revealjs.com/vertical-slides/#navigation-mode][navigation mode]]
    of reveal.js.  Use URL parameter ~default-navigation~ to revert
    to the default navigation mode of reveal.js
    (e.g., https://oer.gitlab.io/emacs-reveal-howto/howto.html?default-navigation).
- PDF export
  - Use URL parameter ~print-pdf~
    (e.g., https://oer.gitlab.io/OS/Operating-Systems-JiTT.html?print-pdf),
    then print to PDF file (usually, Ctrl-p)
    - Reveal.js documents this to work with Chromium/Chrome,
      [[https://revealjs.com/pdf-export/][suggested settings]]
    - Newer build pipelines may generate this type of PDF as well;
      your instructor might inform you about this
  - Alternatively, depending on the specific project, PDFs might also
    have been generated via LaTeX from org source files.  If
    available, those PDF versions are accessible by replacing
    ~.html~ in a presentation’s URL with ~.pdf~
  - Alternatively, instead of PDF export you may want to download and
    annotate/enrich source files
    - [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]], which is plain text
- Offline use
  - Presentations can be downloaded from build pipelines of
    source projects as self-contained zip archives
    - Extract contents and open local HTML file(s) in browser
    - E.g., for a course on Operating Systems, go to
      [[https://gitlab.com/oer/OS/-/pipelines][its pipelines page]],
      click on download icon of most recent pipeline
  - Alternatively, clone source repository and build presentations locally
- Audio
  - If audio is embedded, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg][the free Ogg format]] is used
    - Based on student feedback, playback does /not/ start
      automatically (but since August 2021 you can use URL parameter
      ~audio-autoplay~ to change this preference)
      - See [[https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins/tree/master/audio-slideshow#user-content-compatibility-and-known-issues][compatibility and known issues of the underlying audio plugin]]
      - [[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/][Firefox]],
        seems to work everywhere
    - Audio controls are shown at bottom left (use right-click for
      more controls such as Play Speed)
      - Set the playback speed for the entire presentation with URL
        parameter ~audio-speed~, e.g., ~audio-speed=2.0~ for double
        speed (parameter added in June 2022)
    - To toggle audio, type “a” (or “+” for older presentations)
- Notes
  - Slides contain additional notes as plain text if you see the
    folder icon
    [[./reveal.js/dist/theme/folder_inbox.png]]
    - Press “v” to open the “courseware view” or click on that icon or
      press “s” to see the “speaker notes view”
      - For the speaker notes view you need to allow pop-ups
      - If the pop-up window does not work, you may need to press “s”
        twice or close the pop-up window once
  - If the slide contains audio, the notes are a transcript of the
    audio’s text
- Links
  - In presentations, internal and external links (the former are also
    called relative, while the latter embed a domain in the URL) are styled
    differently
    - Different colors for internal (blue) and external (green) links
      - Internal links that stay within the presentation come with
        additional indicators whether they point to a previous (◂) or
        an upcoming (▸) slide
    - Special link icons for “non-local” links
      - A generic indicator as in this
        [[https://moz.com/learn/seo/external-link][external link to a page explaining external links]],
        which are typically served by independent organizations with
        their own agendas, with or without their own privacy policies
      - But also for links between different presentations (in
        particular, this allows to recognize forward references, which
        may be safely ignored upon first contact)
      - Besides, special icons may indicate whether the
        non-local link leads to
        - basic contents, e.g.,
          [[basic:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment][enlightenment]]
          (if you cannot explain the linked term, you may want to
          follow the link before proceeding; this does not imply that
          you need to read all of the linked page…),
        - contents beyond learning objectives, e.g.,
          [[beyond:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography][post-quantum cryptography]]
          (which you can ignore for grading purposes)
        - contents that are introduced briefly and revisited with more
          details later on (icon ↔)
    - In summary, presentations (not this page) use several link styles:
      - External (green with icon)
        - Possibly with different icons hinting at “importance”
      - Relative into different presentation (blue with icon)
      - Relative within presentation (blue), either with backward (◂) or
        forward (▸) indicator
  - Some students ask for the removal of links.  This can be
    configured with URL parameter ~hidelinks~, which
    hides most links.  In addition, with a numeric value such as
    ~hidelinks=24~, different types of links are hidden based on the
    following bit values:
    - 1: Hide backward links
    - 2: Hide forward links
    - 4: Hide links between presentations
    - 8: Hide links to other resources under ~oer.gitlab.io~
    - 16: Hide external links
    - 32: Hide links going beyond current scope
    E.g., with ~hidelinks=28~ (28 = 16 + 8 + 4) neither external
    links (16) nor links to other resources under ~oer.gitlab.io~ (8)
    nor links to other presentations (4) would be displayed

Reveal.js is restricted on mobile browsers without keyboard shortcuts.
Newer presentations (since April 2022) allow, depending on OS and
browser, to open in fullscreen mode (without superfluous address bar)
if the presentation is added as app icon the home screen and started
from there.
