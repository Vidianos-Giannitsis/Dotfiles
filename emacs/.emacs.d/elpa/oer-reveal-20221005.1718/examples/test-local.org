#+Title: Presentation with local link
#+Author: Jens Lechtenbörger

* What’s this?
  - A [[https://revealjs.com/][reveal.js]] presentation
    - See [[local:/hints.html][Usage hints]]
      vs [[/hints.html][Usage hints]]
      - Quite likely, none of these links works out the box for you, but
        note that the former results in a relative URL while the
        latter results in a file link.
      - Also, when including files (with ~#+INCLUDE~), Org
        treatment may lead to unwanted results; then ~local~ may be
        appropriate.
