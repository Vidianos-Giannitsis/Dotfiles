This repository embeds different resources under different (free/libre
and open) license terms, following the REUSE best practices, see:
https://reuse.software/

As required for REUSE, the subdirectory LICENSES contains license
terms with their identifiers.  Those identifiers are included in
source files to clarify their license terms.  Some files do not
include license identifiers but come with an additional file whose
name ends in ".license"; that latter file either points to a license
or embeds usage terms.
