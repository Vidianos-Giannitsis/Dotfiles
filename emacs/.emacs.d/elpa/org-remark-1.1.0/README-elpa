1 Introduction
══════════════

  Org-remark lets you highlight and annotate text files and websites
  with using Org mode [1].

  A user manual is available [online] or Emacs in-system as an Info node
  `(org-remark)': (`C-h i' and find the `Org-remark' node).

  For installation and minimum configuration, refer to [Installation]
  below or the user manual: [online] or Info node `(org-remark)
  Installation'

  Getting Started in the user manual will get you started in 5 minutes:
  [online] or or Info node `(org-remark) Getting Started'.

  For customization, refer to the customization group `org-remark' or
  user manual: [online] or Info node `(org-remark) Customizing'.

  An [introductory video] (8 minutes) is available on YouTube.

2 Features
══════════

  • Highlight and annotate any text file. The highlights and notes are
    kepted in an Org file as the plain text database. This lets you
    easily manage your marginal notes and use the built-in Org
    fecilities on them – e.g. create a sparse tree based on the category
    of the notes

  • Have the same highlighting and annotating functionality for websites
    when you use EWW to browse them (new in latest [GNU-devel ELPA] and
    is planned to be part of v1.1.0.)

  • Create your your own highlighter pens with different colors, type
    (e.g. underline, squiggle, etc. optionally with Org's category for
    search and filter on your highlights and notes)

3 Installation
══════════════

  This package is available on:

  • [GNU-ELPA] (releases only; equivalent to MELPA-Stable)
  • [GNU-devel ELPA] (unreleased development branch; equivalent to
    MELPA)

  GNU ELPA should be already set up in your Emacs by default. If you
  wish to add GNU-devel ELPA, simply add its URL to `package-archives'
  like this:

  ┌────
  │ (add-to-list 'package-archives
  │ 	     '("gnu-devel" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/") :append)
  └────

  After installation, we suggest you put the setup below in your
  configuration.

  ┌────
  │ (org-remark-global-tracking-mode +1)
  │ 
  │ ;; Optional if you would like to highlight websites via eww-mode
  │ (with-eval-after-load 'eww
  │   (org-remark-eww-mode +1))
  └────

  Unless you explicitly load `org' during Emacs initialization, I
  suggest to defer loading `org-remark' (thus there is no `(require
  'org-remark)' in the example above). This is because it will also pull
  in `org', which can slow down initialization. You can control the
  timing of loading `org-remark' by autoloading some commands in a
  similar way with the example keybindings below.

  Below are example keybindings you might like to consider:

  ┌────
  │ ;; Key-bind `org-remark-mark' to global-map so that you can call it
  │ ;; globally before the library is loaded.
  │ 
  │ (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c n m") #'org-remark-mark)
  │ 
  │ ;; The rest of keybidings are done only on loading `org-remark'
  │ (with-eval-after-load 'org-remark
  │   (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n o") #'org-remark-open)
  │   (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n ]") #'org-remark-view-next)
  │   (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n [") #'org-remark-view-prev)
  │   (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n r") #'org-remark-remove))
  └────
