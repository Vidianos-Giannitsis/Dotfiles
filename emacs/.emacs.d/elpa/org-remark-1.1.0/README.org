* Breaking Changes :noexport:

- [18 January 2022] Package name change from Org-marginalia to Org-remark. See [[https://github.com/nobiot/org-remark/issues/11#issuecomment-1382824948][detail on data conversion]]. In most cases, no action is required for you.

* Introduction

Org-remark lets you highlight and annotate text files and websites with
using Org mode [fn:1].

A user manual is available [[https://nobiot.github.io/org-remark/][online]] or Emacs in-system as an Info node `(org-remark)': (~C-h i~ and find the =Org-remark= node).

For installation and minimum configuration, refer to [[#installation][Installation]] below or the user manual: [[https://nobiot.github.io/org-remark/#Installation][online]] or Info node `(org-remark) Installation'

Getting Started in the user manual will get you started in 5 minutes: [[https://nobiot.github.io/org-remark/#getting-started][online]] or or Info node `(org-remark) Getting Started'.

For customization, refer to the customization group `org-remark' or user manual: [[https://nobiot.github.io/org-remark/#Customizing][online]] or Info node `(org-remark) Customizing'.

An [[https://youtu.be/c8DHrAsFiLc][introductory video]] (8 minutes) is available on YouTube.

[fn:1]: Feature to highlight and annotate websites is new in the latest [[https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/org-remark.html][GNU-devel ELPA]] and is part of v1.1.0.

* Features

- Highlight and annotate any text file. The highlights and notes are kepted in an Org file as the plain text database. This lets you easily manage your marginal notes and use the built-in Org fecilities on them -- e.g. create a sparse tree based on the category of the notes

- Have the same highlighting and annotating functionality for websites when you use EWW to browse them (new in latest [[https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/org-remark.html][GNU-devel ELPA]] and is planned to be part of v1.1.0.)

- Create your your own highlighter pens with different colors, type (e.g. underline, squiggle, etc. optionally with Org's category for search and filter on your highlights and notes)

* Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: installation
:END:

This package is available on:

- [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/org-remark.html][GNU-ELPA]] (releases only; equivalent to MELPA-Stable)
- [[https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/org-remark.html][GNU-devel ELPA]] (unreleased development branch; equivalent to MELPA)

GNU ELPA should be already set up in your Emacs by default. If you wish to add GNU-devel ELPA, simply add its URL to ~package-archives~ like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("gnu-devel" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/") :append)
#+END_SRC

After installation, we suggest you put the setup below in your configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (org-remark-global-tracking-mode +1)

  ;; Optional if you would like to highlight websites via eww-mode
  (with-eval-after-load 'eww
    (org-remark-eww-mode +1))
#+end_src

Unless you explicitly load ~org~ during Emacs initialization, I suggest to defer loading ~org-remark~ (thus there is no ~(require 'org-remark)~ in the example above). This is because it will also pull in ~org~, which can slow down initialization. You can control the timing of loading ~org-remark~ by autoloading some commands in a similar way with the example keybindings below.

Below are example keybindings you might like to consider:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Key-bind `org-remark-mark' to global-map so that you can call it
  ;; globally before the library is loaded.

  (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c n m") #'org-remark-mark)

  ;; The rest of keybidings are done only on loading `org-remark'
  (with-eval-after-load 'org-remark
    (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n o") #'org-remark-open)
    (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n ]") #'org-remark-view-next)
    (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n [") #'org-remark-view-prev)
    (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n r") #'org-remark-remove))
#+end_src

This section is created by Org-remark for the source file. It serves as an example to illustrate what Org-remark can do.

** defmacro org-remark-create

This macro was inspired by [[https://github.com/jkitchin/ov-highlight][Ov-highlight]].  It's by John Kitchin (author of Org-ref). Great UX for markers with hydra. Saves the marker info and comments directly within the Org file as Base64 encoded string. It uses overlays with using ~ov~ package.
