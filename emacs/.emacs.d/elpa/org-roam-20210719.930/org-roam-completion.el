;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library provides completion-at-point functions for Org-roam.
;;
;; The two main functions provided to capf are:
;;
;;    `org-roam-complete-link-at-point' provides completions to nodes
;;    within link brackets
;;
;;    `org-roam-complete-everywhere' provides completions for nodes everywhere,
;;    matching the symbol at point
;;
