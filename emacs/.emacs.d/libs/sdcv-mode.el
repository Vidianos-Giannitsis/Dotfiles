;;; Commentary:

;; This is a major mode to view output of dictionary search of sdcv.

;; Put this file into your load-path and the following into your
;; ~/.emacs:
;;   (require 'sdcv-mode)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d") 'sdcv-search)

;;; Changelog:

;; 2012/01/02
;;     * New variable: `sdcv-word-processor'
;;     * Breaking change:
;;       for `sdcv-dictionary-list' and `sdcv-dictionary-alist',
;;       non-list (non-nil) value now means full dictionary list
;;     * Rewrite `sdcv-search' for both interactive and non-interactive use
;;     * `sdcv-dictionary-list' is left for customization use only
;;     * Better highlighting.
;;
;; 2011/06/30
;;     * New feature: parse output for failed lookup
;;     * Keymap modification
;;
;; 2008/06/11
;;     * sdcv-mode v 0.1 init (with background process)

The result will be displayed in buffer named with

Alternatively, dictionary list can be specified directly
by DICT-LIST.  Any non-list value of it means using all dictionaries.
When called interactively, prompt for the word.

If `sdcv-dictionary-alist' is defined, 
use prefix argument to select a new DICT-LIST-NAME.
Otherwise, prefix argument means using all dictionaries.
