;;;###autoload
(define-minor-mode org-marginalia-mode
    "Highlight text, write margin notes for any text file in Org Mode.
This is a local minor-mode.
On activation, it loads your saved highlights from the marginalia
file and enables automatic saving of highlights.
The automatic saving is achieved via function
`org-marginalia-save' added to `after-save-hook'.
On deactivation, it removes all the overlays and stops tracking
the highlights in this buffer by setting variable
`org-marginalia-highlights' to nil. Be careful of behavior, if
you still wish to retain the locations of highlights.
It is recommended to use `org-marginalia-toggle' if you wish to
temporarily hide highlights in the current buffer. It keeps
`org-marginalia-highlights' unchanged.
While the tracking of highlights is stopped,
editing the buffer will likely result in mismatch between the
saved highlights' locations and the current buffer's text
content.
Highlights tracked by variable `org-marginalia-highlights' cannot
persist when you kill the buffer or quit Emacs. When you
re-launch Emacs and visit the same file, ensure to turn on
`org-marginalia-mode' to load the highlights from the marginalia
file. `org-marginalia-global-tracking-mode' can automate this.
